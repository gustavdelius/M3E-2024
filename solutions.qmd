*Von Bertalanffy growth*

i) Seeking a steady state we find $\alpha w^{2/3}-\beta w = 0$  $\implies$  $w^{2/3}(\alpha-\beta w^{1/3})=0$ $\implies$ $w=0$ or $w^{1/3} = \alpha/\beta$.
With the graphical approach in @fig-vonBertalanffy-growth we see that the non-zero steady state is stable. Hence, 
$$
\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} w(t) = \left( \frac{\alpha}{\beta} \right)^{3}.
$$

ii) For the time derivative of $u=w^{1/3}$ we find by the chain rule that
$$
\frac{du}{dt} = \frac13 w^{-2/3} \frac{dw}{dt} = \frac{1}{3u^2}\left( \alpha w^{2/3}-\beta w \right).
$$
Hence
$$
3\frac{du}{dt} = \frac{1}{u^2}\left( \alpha u^2-\beta u^3 \right) = \alpha-\beta u.
$$
So this change of variables has yielded a first-order ODE with linear coefficients, which is easy for us to solve:
$$
u(t) = \frac{1}{\beta} \left( \alpha  - Ae^{-\beta t/3}\right)
$$
for some integration constant $A$. If $u(0)=u_0$ then $A=\alpha -\beta u_0$.

iii) Translating back to $w$ with $w_0=u_0^3$ we finally have
$$
w(t) = u(t)^3 = \frac{1}{\beta^3}\left( \alpha - \left( \alpha - \beta w_0^{1/3} \right) e^{-\beta t/3}  \right)^3.
$$

### @exr-logistic_solution {.unnumbered}
*Solving logistic equation*

We separate the variables by dividing both sides of the ODE by $N(1-N/K)$ and multiplying by $dt$, and then integrate to get
$$
\int_{N_0}^{N(t)}\frac{dN}{N\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right)}=\int_0^t r\,dt.$$
The right hand side is trivial to integrate, but for the integral on the left-hand side we need to employ the
method of partial fractions, using that
$$\frac{dN}{N\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right)}=\frac{1}{N}+\frac{1}{K-N}.$$
The left-hand side then gives
$$
\int_{N_0}^{N(t)}\left(\frac{1}{N}+\frac{1}{K-N(t)}\right)dN=\log N(t)-\log N_0-\log(K-N(t))+\log(K-N_0).$$
We exponentiate both sides to get
$$\frac{N(t)}{N_0}\frac{K-N_0}{K-N(t)}=e^{rt}.$$
Now we just need to solve for $N(t)$:
$$N(t)=\frac{N_0Ke^{rt}}{K+N_0(e^{rt}-1)}.$$

### @exr-harvest_quota {.unnumbered}
*Harvesting with fixed quota*

If we harvest with a fixed quota $Q$, the population is described by the equation
$$
\frac{dN}{dt} = \alpha N \log\frac{K}{N} - Q.
$$
The subtraction of $Q$ shifts the graph of the right-hand side down by a distance $Q$. This brings the non-zero fixed points closer together until $Q$ is equal to the maximum of the growth rate of the unfished population. If $Q$ is increased beyond this value the non-zero fixed points disappear and the population will go extinct. is because we are removing $Q$ individuals from the population at a constant rate. Thus the maximum sustainable
yield occurs when $Q$ equals the maximum replenishment rate of the unfished population. To find that
maximum we first solve
$$
0=\frac{d}{dN}\left(\alpha N \log\frac{K}{N}\right)=\alpha\left(\log\frac{K}{N}-1\right).
$$
This tells us that the maximum is at
$$
N_{max} = K\,e^{-1}.
$$
Hence the value at the maximum is
$$MSY=Q_{max}=\alpha N_{max} \log\frac{K}{N_{max}}=\alpha\,K\,e^{-1}.$$
Fishing at this quota is not wise, as this reduces the population to the threshold level below which the population will go extinct. 


### @exr-Hornet {.unnumbered}
*Wasps*

For $0\leq t\leq t_c$ the number of workers satisfies
$$
\frac{dn}{dt}=r\,n.
$$
Therefore
$$
n(t)=n_0e^{r\,t}.
$$

For $t_c\leq t\leq T$ the number of reproducers satisfies
$$
\frac{dN}{dt}=Rn(t_c)=R\,n_0\,e^{r\,t_c},
$$
so that
$$
N(T)=(T-t_c)R\,e^{r\,t_c}.
$$

To find the value of $t_c$ that maximises $N(T)$ we set the derivative of $N(T)$ with respect to $t_c$ to zero:
$$
0=\frac{d}{dt_c}N(T)=\frac{d}{dt_c}(T-t_c)R\,e^{r\,t_c}=-R\,e^{r\,t_c}+(T-t_c)R\,r\,e^{r\,t_c}
=R\,e^{r\,t_c}(r\,T-r\,t_c-1).
$$
This implies that
$$
t_c=T-\frac{1}{r}.
$$


### @exr-wasp_death {.unnumbered}
*Wasp with death*

For $0\leq t\leq t_c$ the number of workers satisfies
$$\frac{dn}{dt}=(r-d)n.$$
Therefore
$$n(t)=e^{(r-d)t}.$$
For $t_c\leq t\leq T$ we have
$$\frac{dn}{dt}=-dn$$
so that
$$n(t)=n(t_c)e^{-d(t-t_c)}=e^{(r-d)t}e^{-d(t-t_c)}=e^{r\,t_c}e^{-d\,t}.$$
Also for $t_c\leq t\leq T$ the number of reproducers satisfies
$$\frac{dN}{dt}=Rn(t)=Re^{r\,t_c}e^{-d\,t},$$
so that
$$N(T)=\int_{t_c}^TRe^{r\,t_c}e^{-d\,t}dt = \frac{R}{d}e^{r\,t_c}\left(e^{-d\,t_c}-e^{-d\,T}\right).$$
To find the value of $t_c$ that maximises $N(T)$ we set the derivative of $N(T)$ with respect to $t_c$ to zero:
$$0=\frac{d}{dt_c}N(T)=\frac{d}{dt_c}\left( \frac{R}{d}e^{r\,t_c}\left(e^{-d\,t_c}-e^{-d\,T}\right)\right)
=Re^{r\,t_c}\left(\left(\frac{r}{d}-1\right)e^{-d\,t_c}-\frac{r}{d}e^{-d\,T}\right)$$
This is equivalent to 
$$e^{-d\,t_c}=\frac{1}{1-d/r}e^{-d\,T}$$
and thus
$$t_c=T+\frac{1}{d}\ln\left(1-\frac{d}{r}\right).$$

## Discrete-time population models

### @exr-discrete_logistic {.unnumbered}
*Verhulst model*

Let's write the equation as $N_{t+1}=f(N_t)$ with
$$
f(N)=rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right).
$$

Because $f(N)$ is positive for all $N<K$, the only way for $N_{t+1}$ to be negative
is for $N_t$ to be greater than $K$. This in turn is only possible if $f(N_{t-1})>K$. So the function $f$ at its maximum needs to be larger than $K$. Because the function describes an upside-down parabola with
zeros at $0$ and $K$, its maximum is in the middle at $N=K/2$, where $f(K/2)=rK/4$. Thus the population can get negative iff $rK/4>K$, which is equivalent to $r>4$.



## Age-structured population models

### @exr-age_harvesting {.unnumbered}
*Harvestings an age-structured population*

We can start from @eq-a14 that gives the expected number of offspring produced by an individual within their lifetime:
$$
\phi(0) = \int_0^\infty b(a) \exp\left(-\int_0^a \mu(a') \, da'\right)\, da.
$$
This will now simplify when we use the given expressions @eq-age_harvesting_1 and @eq-age_harvesting_2 for the rates. Because $b(a)$ is non-zero only for $a>a_m$, the outer integral only has to run from $a_m$ to $\infty$. The inner integral from $0$ to $a$ we need to split into two integrals because of the piece-wise nature of $\mu(a)$. Hence
$$
\phi(0) = \int_{a_m}^\infty b(a) \exp\left(-\int_0^{a_m} \mu(a') \, da'
-\int_{a_m}^a \mu(a') \, da'\right)\, da.
$$
We can now substitute the appropriate constants for the rates:
$$
\begin{split}
\phi(0) &= \int_{a_m}^\infty b\, \exp\left(-\int_0^{a_m} \mu_0 \, da'
-\int_{a_m}^a (\mu_0+\mu_F) \, da'\right)\, da\\
&= \int_{a_m}^\infty b\, \exp\left(-\mu_0 a_m - (\mu_0+\mu_F)(a-a_m)\right)\, da\\
&= b\,\exp(-\mu_F a_m) \int_{a_m}^\infty \, \exp\left(- (\mu_0+\mu_F)a\right)\, da\\
&= b\,\exp(-\mu_F a_m) \left[-\frac{1}{\mu_0+\mu_F}\exp\left(- (\mu_0+\mu_F)a\right)\right]_{a_m}^\infty\\
&= b\,\exp(-\mu_F a_m)  \frac{1}{\mu_0+\mu_F}\exp\left(- (\mu_0+\mu_F)a_m\right)\\
&= \frac{b}{\mu_0+\mu_F}\exp\left(-\mu_0a_m\right).
\end{split}
$$
This expected number of offspring produced by an individual within their lifetime must be greater or equal to $1$ for the population to sustain itself. Hence the upper limit on the harvesting rate $\mu_F$ is given by
$$
\mu_F \leq b\exp\left(-\mu_0a_m\right) - \mu_0.
$$
