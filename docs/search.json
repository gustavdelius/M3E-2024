    "text": "1.1 Exponential model\nThis is the simplest and oldest model, introduced by Thomas Robert Malthus in 1798. If we assume that the per-capita birth rate \\(b\\) and the per-capita death rate \\(d\\) are fixed constants, then the general differential equation Eq. 1.1 becomes the linear equation \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt}=bN-dN=rN,\n\\tag{1.2}\\] where we introduced the new parameter \\(r=b-d\\). This equation is easy to solve: \\[\nN(t)=N_0\\,e^{rt}.\n\\tag{1.3}\\] If the birth rate exceeds the death rate and hence \\(r&gt;0\\), the model predicts exponential growth. In the opposite case of lower birth rate than death rate the model predicts exponential decay of the population number towards extinction. Only when birth and death rates are perfectly equal can the population stay steady over time. We illustrate that in Figure 1.1.\nFigure 1.1: Solutions to the exponential model.",

When the population gets closer to this limit its growth rate will decrease, for example due to competition for limited food sources or space, or due to disease. This decrease in the growth rate is captured by the logistic equation \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K}\\right),\n\\tag{1.4}\\] where \\(K\\) is the carrying capacity of the environment.

    "text": "1.3 Allee effect\nWarder Clyde Allee (1885-1955) was an American ecologist who studied the effects of population density on the growth rate of a population. He found that in some cases the per-capita growth rate can increase with \\(N\\). This is called the Allee effect. It can occur when the population is too small to find a mate, to find food, or to avoid predators.\nFigure Figure 1.4 shows the per-capita growth rate as a function of the population number for exponential growth in black, for logistic growth in blue and two different growth rates exhibiting the Allee effect in green and red.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: The per-capita growth rate as a function of the population number.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe green curve in Figure 1.4 shows a weak Allee effect, where the per-capita rate is small but possitive for small population sizes, then initially increases with the population size before then decreasing again as the population approaches its carrying capacity. The red curve shows a strong Allee effect, which is similar but so strong that the growth rate starts out not just small but actually negative for small \\(N\\).\nThe simplest model for the Allee effect is the logistic equation with a modified growth rate that includes another factor that decreases the growth rate for small \\(N\\): \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K}\\right)\\left(\\frac{N}{K_0}-1\\right).\n\\tag{1.6}\\] If \\(0&lt;K_0&lt;K\\), this exhibits the strong Allee effect because the growth rate is negative when \\(N&lt;K_0\\). This means that the population will be driven towards extinction when it is below the threshold size \\(K_0\\) and it will grow towards its carrying capacity when it is above \\(K_0\\). This is illustrated in Figure 1.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: The Allee growth rate as a function of the population number.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis phenomenon is important for conservation biology because it means that small populations are particularly vulnerable to extinction. It is also important for fisheries management because it means that the population can collapse if it falls below a certain threshold size. The phenomenon is called “critical depensation”. We will meet it again when we discuss harvesting later in this section.",

    "text": "1.4 General autonomous ODE model\nThe logistic model is a special case of a general autonomous ordinary differential equation (ODE) model \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt}=f(N),\n\\tag{1.7}\\] where \\(f(N)\\) is a function of \\(N\\) only, not \\(t\\). The logistic equation Eq. 1.4 is an example of such a model with\n\\[\nf(N)=rN\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K}\\right).\n\\]\nIf \\(f\\) is Lipschitz continuous, then, given \\(N(0)=N_0\\), there exists a unique solution \\(N(t)\\) to the initial value problem Eq. 1.7. This is a consequence of the Picard-Lindelöf theorem.\nWe are interested in the steady states of the model, i.e. the values \\(N^*\\) for which \\(f(N^*)=0\\). These are the values of \\(N\\) for which the population number does not change. To determine the stability of the steady states, we can look near \\(N^*\\) by writing \\(N(t)=N^*+n(t)\\) with \\(n(t)\\) small. Then \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt}=\\frac{dN^*}{dt}+\\frac{dn}{dt} = f(N^*+n(t))\\approx f(N^*)+f'(N^*)\\,n(t).\n\\] We now use that \\(dN^*/dt=0\\) and \\(f(N^*)=0\\) to find \\[\n\\frac{dn}{dt}\\approx f'(N^*)\\,n(t).\n\\] This is a linear equation for \\(n(t)\\) with solution \\[\nn(t)=n(0)e^{f'(N^*)t}\n\\] and we can use the sign of \\(f'(N^*)\\) to determine the stability of the steady state:\n\nIf \\(f'(N^*)&lt;0\\), then \\(n(t)\\) will decrease towards zero, and the steady state is stable.\nIf \\(f'(N^*)&gt;0\\), then \\(n(t)\\) will increase away from zero, and the steady state is unstable.\n\nIf \\(f'(N^*)=0\\), then we need to look at higher order terms to determine the stability.\nWe illustrate this in the example of the logistic model. The fixed points are \\(N^*=0\\) and \\(N^*=K\\). The derivative of \\(f(N)\\) is \\[\nf'(N)=r\\left(1-\\frac{2N}{K}\\right).\n\\] So we find that \\(f'(0)=r&gt;0\\) and \\(f'(K)=-r&lt;0\\). This means that the steady state \\(N^*=0\\) is unstable and the steady state \\(N^*=K\\) is stable. This agrees with what we had already seen graphically in Figure 1.2 and Figure 1.3.",

    "section": "1.5 Harvesting a renewable resource",
    "text": "1.5 Harvesting a renewable resource\nEcologists model populations not only out of academic interest but also for practical purposes. Humans are interested in exploiting the natural resources. They want o harvest fish from the sea, to hunt deer in the forest, and to cut down trees in the jungle. They want to do this in a way that is sustainable, i.e. that does not lead to the extinction of the resource, while at the same time giving the highest yield.\nMy personal interest is in understanding how fish populations react to different kinds of fishing. I use coupled partial integro-differential equations for that purpose, but most fisheries management is based on simpler models and we get a good first idea by using the logistic model, which we will now modify to include harvesting.\n\n1.5.1 Harvesting with fixed effort\nWe assume that in the absence of fishing the fish population number \\(N(t)\\) is governed by the logistic equation Eq. 1.4. We also assume that the fish are harvested at a rate \\(E N(t)\\), where \\(E\\) is the harvesting rate, which is determined by the effort that is put into fishing. This means that the rate of change in the fish population number is given by \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K}\\right)-EN = f(N).\n\\tag{1.8}\\] We can rewrite this equation in the form of a logistic equation with modified parameters: \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\\left(\\left(1-\\frac{E}{r}\\right)-\\frac{N}{K}\\right).\n\\tag{1.9}\\] This makes it easy to read off the fixed points \\(N^*=0\\) and \\(N^*=K\\left(1-\\frac{E}{r}\\right)\\). The nonzero fixed point gets smaller when fishing effort \\(E\\) increases. This is illustrated in Figure 1.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Growth rate when harvesting with fixed effort.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are now interested in finding out at what level we should fish in order to achive the maximum sustainable yield (MSY). This is the level of fishing effort that gives the highest possible yield that can be sustained indefinitely. So we are interested in the yield at the non-zero fixed point \\(N^*=K\\left(1-\\frac{E}{r}\\right)\\). The yield is the amount of fish that can be harvested per unit time, and it is given at the fixed point by \\[\nY=EN^*=EK\\left(1-\\frac{E}{r}\\right).\n\\] We can find the maximum of \\(Y\\) by differentiating with respect to \\(E\\) and setting the derivative equal to zero: \\[\n\\frac{dY}{dE}=K\\left(1-\\frac{2E}{r}\\right)=0.\n\\] We can solve this equation for \\(E\\) to find the optimal fishing effort \\(E^*\\): \\[\nE^*=\\frac{r}{2}.\n\\] The resulting maximum sustainable yield is \\[\nMSY=\\frac{r}{2}K\\left(1-\\frac{r}{2r}\\right)=\\frac{rK}{4}.\n\\]\n\n\n1.5.2 Harvesting with fixed quote\nFisheries managers in the Mediterranean are aiming to control the fishing effort in order to achieve the maximum sustainable yield, and we have seen how to model that in the previous section. Fisheries in the North Sea or the North Atlantic however are instead managed by setting the total allowable catch (TAC) for the whole fleet. This is a fixed quota for the total amount of fish that can be harvested in a year. To model that policy we use the logistic equation with harvesting, but we replace the harvesting rate \\(EN\\) by a harvesting quota \\(Q\\): \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K}\\right)-Q.\n\\tag{1.10}\\] This is visualised in Figure 1.7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.7: Growth rate when harvesting with fixed quota.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that any non-zero quota leads to critical depensation, i.e., it introduces a critical threshold below which the population will collapse. This is a well-known problem in fisheries management, and it is the reason why the TAC is set to zero for some fish stocks. As the fishing quota is increased, the critical depensation threshold moves to higher population numbers and the stable steady state moves to lower population numbers. Eventually all non-zero fixed points disappear and the population collapses.",

Other exercises are optional but recommended.\n\n*Sketching solutions\n\nExercise 1.1 Consider the population model with carrying capacity and Allee effect given by the differential equation \\[\\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K}\\right)\\left(\\frac{N}{K_0}-1\\right).\\] Here \\(r&gt;0\\), \\(K&gt;K_0&gt;0\\) are constants. Simply by considering the shape of the right hand side, sketch a graph with several solutions for different initial conditions. Choose two initial conditions between \\(0\\) and \\(K_0\\), two initial conditions between \\(K_0\\) and \\(K\\) and one initial condition larger than \\(K\\). Note that the graph only needs to be qualitatively correct, similar to the rough sketch for the solutions of the logistic model sketched in the first lecture.\n\n\n\n+Von Bertalanffy growth\n\nExercise 1.2 Assume the weight \\(w(t)\\) of an individual fish at time \\(t\\) is governed by the differential equation \\[\\frac{dw}{dt}=\\alpha\\,w^{2/3}-\\beta w\\] with initial condition \\(w(0)=w_0\\) (the weight at birth), and where \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are positive parameters depending on the fish species.\n\nWithout solving the differential equation, just thinking about fixed points and their stability, determine \\(\\lim_{t\\rightarrow\\infty}w(t)\\).\nDerive the linear first order ODE for \\(u=w^{1/3}\\) and solve it.\nUse the solution for \\(u\\) to find the solution for \\(w\\).\n\n\n\n\nSolving logistic equation\n\nExercise 1.3 By using separation of variables and partial fractions, solve the logistic equation \\[\\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K}\\right)\\] with initial condition \\(N(0)=N_0\\).\n\n\n\n* Harvesting with fixed effort\n\nExercise 1.4 Consider a population \\(N(t)\\) that is described by the by the Gompertz model \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = \\alpha N \\log\\frac{K}{N},\n\\] where \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(K\\) are positive constants. You want to harvest this population, for example by hunting or fishing, with some effort \\(E\\). The rate at which you harvest individuals (which removes them from the population and hence results in an additional source of death) is proportional to the size of the population: \\(Y = E N\\). This is called the yield. Write down the differential equation for \\(N(t)\\) including this harvesting term. Determine the fixed points and their stability. Find the maximum sustainable yield, i.e., the maximum yield that can be sustained indefinitely.\n\n\n\nHarvesting with fixed quota\n\nExercise 1.5 As in Exercise 1.4, consider a population \\(N(t)\\) that is described by the Gompertz model. Imagine that this describes a fish population in a lake where fishing is going to be introduced, and that you are tasked with setting the quota that limits the rate at which the fishers are allowed to take fish out of the lake. The fishers demand that you set the quota to the maximum sustainable level. What is the maximum sustainable quota according to the model? Would it be wise to give in to the demand of the fishers and set the quota at this level?\n\n\n\nWasps\n\nExercise 1.6 In a colony of the European Hornet there is a single queen that produces all the offspring. It produces two kinds of offspring: workers and reproducers. We’ll denote the number of workers alive at time \\(t\\) by \\(n(t)\\) and the number of reproducers by \\(N(t)\\). The workers are responsible for collecting food. They can’t breed themselves and they die in the winter. However they are necessary to allow the queen to reproduce because without the food that they are collecting the queen would have nothing to eat. So we need workers. But because they die in winter, they don’t help the survival of the colony in the long run. That’s where the reproducers come in. They don’t do any work, but they can, if they survive the winter, breed in the next spring as new queens.\nSo the queen now has a strategy of how to proceed: It first of all needs to produce workers, and from time zero to time \\(t_c\\) it only produces workers. We assume that the birth rate is proportional to the number of workers, so that the total birth rate of workers is \\(r n(t)\\) for some constant \\(r&gt;0\\). The queen then switches to producing only reproducers from time \\(t_c\\) up to the start of winter at time \\(T\\) and we assume that the total birth rate of reproducers is \\(R n(t)\\) for some constant \\(R&gt;0\\). We also assume that until the start of winter there are no deaths.\nWhat is the optimal time \\(t_c\\) at which the queen should switch from producing workers to producing reproducers in order to achieve the largest number of producers \\(N(T)\\) at the start of the winter and therefore to the largest number of wasps in the following year.\n\n\n\nWasps with death\n\nExercise 1.7 In the wasp example from question 1, assume that the worker wasps die at a constant per-capita rate \\(d\\) but the reproducers do not die. Also assume that at time t=0 there is one worker, n(0)=1. Keep the birth rates as in Exercise 1.6. Determine the number of workers \\(n(t)\\) for any time between \\(t_c\\) and \\(T\\). Determine the number of reproducers at the onset of winter at time \\(T\\). Derive the optimal time for the switchover time \\(t_c\\).",

    "section": "2.2 Models with limited carrying capacity",
    "text": "2.2 Models with limited carrying capacity\nRecall how we introduced the logistic model by assuming that the per-capita birth rate declines linearly with the population number and vanishes when the population reaches its carrying capacity. This gave us the equation \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = rN\\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right)\n\\tag{2.5}\\] where \\(r\\) is the per-capita growth rate and \\(K\\) is the carrying capacity.\nIt turns out that there are several models which all deserve to be called the discrete-time logistic model.\n\n2.2.1 Verhulst model\nThe most famous discrete-time logistic model is the Verhulst model.\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\nN_{t+1} &= (R_0+1)N_t\\left(1 - \\frac{N_t}{K(R_0+1)/R_0}\\right)\\\\\n&=N_t + R_0 N_t\\left(1 - \\frac{N_t}{K}\\right)=f(N_t).\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{2.6}\\] Again it is important to stress that \\(R_0\\) is not a growth rate but a dimensionless growth factor.\nWe have written the model in two alternative forms because the first form makes the analogy with the continuous-time logistic model more obvious, while the second form makes it easier to read off the fixed point.\nThe fixed point is a value for which \\(N_{t+1}=N_t\\), i.e. a value of \\(N\\) for which the population number does not change from year to year. Thus it is a value \\(N^*\\) for which \\(f(N^*)=N^*\\). Using the second form of the model, we can see easily that the fixed points are \\(N^*=0\\) and \\(N^*=K\\), so \\(K\\) is the carrying capacity.\nA problem with the Verhulst model is that it can give rise to negative population numbers. This is not realistic, so we are motivated to modify the model to prevent this.\n\n\n2.2.2 Ricker model\nThe Ricker model is a modification of the Verhulst model that prevents negative population numbers. It is given by \\[\nN_{t+1} = N_t\\, e^{R_0\\left(1 - \\frac{N_t}{K}\\right)}.\n\\tag{2.7}\\] By moving the logistic factor inside the exponential, the Ricker model prevents negative population numbers. The fixed points are still \\(N^*=0\\) and \\(N^*=K\\). Ricker introduced this model to describe salmon populations.\n\n\n2.2.3 Beverton-Holt model\nThe Beverton-Holt model is another modification of the Verhulst model which prevents negative population numbers. It is given by \\[\nN_{t+1} = \\frac{R N_t}{1 + \\frac{R-1}{K}N_t}.\n\\tag{2.8}\\] This has been a very influential model in fisheries science. On the face of it the model does not look very similar to the logistic model, but we will see the relationship when we solve the model. The Beverton-Holt model is one of the rare cases where a non-linear model can be solved exactly. The trick is to make a change of variables from \\(N_t\\) to \\(u_t = 1/N_t\\). Then we have \\[\nu_{t+1} = \\frac{1}{N_{t+1}} = \\frac{1 + \\frac{R-1}{K}N_t}{R N_t} = \\frac{u_t}{R} + \\frac{R-1}{R K}.\n\\tag{2.9}\\] This is a linear equation for \\(u_t\\), and linear equations are easy to solve. The easiest way to proceed is to look at the first few terms of the sequence \\(u_t\\) and guess the general form of the solution. We find \\[\\begin{split}\nu_1 &= \\frac{u_0}{R} + \\frac{R-1}{R K},\\\\\nu_2 &= \\frac{u_0}{R^2} + \\frac{R-1}{R K}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{R}\\right),\\\\\nu_3 &= \\frac{u_0}{R^3} + \\frac{R-1}{R K}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{R} + \\frac{1}{R^2}\\right),\\\\\n&\\vdots\\\\\nu_t &= \\frac{u_0}{R^t} + \\frac{R-1}{R K}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{R} + \\frac{1}{R^2} + \\ldots + \\frac{1}{R^{t-1}}\\right).\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{2.10}\\] The sum in the second term is a geometric series. We know the general formula for a geometric series: \\[\n1 + x + x^2 + \\ldots + x^{t-1} = \\frac{1 - x^t}{1 - x}.\n\\tag{2.11}\\]\nWe can use this with \\(x=1/R\\) to sum terms in the second term. We find \\[\nu_t = \\frac{u_0}{R^t} + \\frac{R-1}{R K}\\frac{1 - (1/R)^t}{1 - 1/R}.\n\\] We simplify this a bit and bring everything on the same denominator. \\[\nu_t = \\frac{u_0}{R^t} - \\frac{(1/R)^t-1}{K}\n=\\frac{Ku_0-1+R^t}{KR^t}.\n\\tag{2.12}\\]\nWe can now change back to \\(N_t=1/u_t\\) to find the solution to the Beverton-Holt model. We find \\[\\begin{split}\nN_t &= \\frac{1}{u_t}=\\frac{K R^t}{Ku_0-1+R^t}\\\\\n&=\\frac{K/u_0}{KR^{-t}-R^{-t}/u_0+1/u_0}\\\\\n&=\\frac{KN_0}{N_0+(K-N_0)R^{-t}}.\n\\end{split} \\tag{2.13}\\]\nThis is the solution to the Beverton-Holt model. Comparing this to the solution of the continuous-time logistic model \\[\nN(t) = \\frac{KN_0}{N_0+(K-N_0)\\exp(-rt)}\n\\tag{2.14}\\] we see that they agree at integer times \\(t\\) if we measure time in years and set \\(R=\\exp(r \\cdot 1\\text{ year}).\\)",

    "text": "2.3 Stability and Cobwebs\nWe now want to study the stability of the fixed points in discrete-time models. As discussed, fixed points \\(N^*\\) satisfy the equation \\(N^*=f(N^*)\\). We study the stability of the fixed points by looking at the sequence \\(N_t\\) for \\(t\\) close to the fixed point. That means we write \\(N(t)=N^*+n_t\\) for \\(n_t&lt;&lt;1\\). We then have \\[\n\\begin{split}\nN_{t+1} = N^*+n_{t+1}=f(N_t) = f(N^*+n_t) = f(N^*) + f'(N^*)n_t + \\ldots\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{2.15}\\] where we have used the Taylor expansion of \\(f\\) around \\(N^*\\). Because \\(N^*\\) is a fixed point, we have \\(f(N^*)=N^*\\). Thus we find that \\[\nn_{t+1} \\approx f'(N^*)n_t\n\\tag{2.16}\\] where we neglected the higher order terms in the Taylor expansion. This is a linear equation for \\(n_t\\) that we know how to solve: \\[\nn_t = n_0 (f'(N^*))^t.\n\\tag{2.17}\\] So we have found that:\n\nIf \\(|f'(N^*)|&lt;1\\), then \\(n_t\\) will decrease with time and the fixed point is stable.\nIf \\(|f'(N^*)|&gt;1\\), then \\(n_t\\) will increase with time and the fixed point is unstable.\n\nIf \\(|f'(N^*)|=1\\), then we cannot say anything about the stability of the fixed point from this analysis.\nIn the continuous-time case we also had a graphical way to see the stability of fixed points. We will now introduce a graphical method for studying the stability of fixed points in discrete-time models, called the cobweb method.\nWe plot the function \\(f(N_t)\\) and the line \\(N_{t+1}=N_t\\). The fixed points are the intersection points of the function and the line. We then draw the graph of the sequence \\(N_t\\) by starting at the initial population number \\(N_0\\) and iterating the function \\(f(N_t)\\) to find \\(N_1\\), then iterating the function again to find \\(N_2\\), and so on. The graph of the sequence \\(N_t\\) is called the cobweb. The stability of the fixed points can be read off from the cobweb. If the cobweb spirals into the fixed point, as shown in Figure 2.1, then the fixed point is stable. If the cobweb spirals out of the fixed point, as shown in Figure 2.2, then the fixed point is unstable.

    "text": "2.4 Discrete-time harvesting model\nWe will now look at an example of a discrete-time model with harvesting and apply the techniques we have learned. The model has the standard discrete-time model form \\(N_{t+1}=f(N_t)\\), where \\(f\\) in our example is \\[\nf(N) = \\frac{b N^2}{1+N^2}-EN.\n\\] The constant \\(b&gt;2\\) determines the growth rate of the population and the harvesting rate is determined by the harvesting effort \\(E\\).\nWe start by studying the model without harvesting, so we set \\(E=0\\) for now. As usual, we start by looking at the steady states of the model. The fixed points are the solutions to the equation \\[\nN^* = \\frac{b\\,{N^*}^2}{1+{N^*}^2}.\n\\] There is the obvious solution \\(N^*=0\\). We can then find the non-zero solutions by dividing both sides by \\(N^*\\) and multiply them by \\(1+{N^*}^2\\) to get the equation \\[\n1+{N^*}^2 = bN^*.\n\\] This is a quadratic equation for \\(N^*\\), which we could rewrite in the more convential form \\[\n{N^*}^2 - bN^* + 1 = 0.\n\\] The solutions to this equation are \\[\nN^*_\\pm = \\frac{b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4}}{2}.\n\\] The solutions are real if \\(b^2-4\\geq 0\\), i.e. if \\(b\\geq 2\\), which we have stipulated earlier. Both solutions are positive.\nWe now have enough information to draw a good sketch to understand the dynamics of the model. We can draw the function \\(f(N)\\) and the line \\(N_{t+1}=N_t\\). It may not be immediately obvious what the sketch of \\(f(N)=bN^2/(1+N^2)\\) looks like. We’ll reason ourselves through this in steps:\n\nFirst let us consider what happens near \\(N=0\\). There the function is approximately \\(f(N)\\approx bN^2\\). This is a parabola that opens upwards. The function is zero at \\(N=0\\) and increases quadratically with \\(N\\).\nNext we consider what happens as \\(N\\) becomes large. There the function is approximately \\(f(N)\\approx b\\). So the graph has a horizontal asymptote at \\(y=b\\).\nWe know that in between there are two fixed points. That means the graph needs to cross the diagonal line \\(y=N\\) twice.\nFinally we observe that the function is monotonically increasing.\n\nIf we now draw something that has all these features, we will have a sufficiently good sketch of the function for our purpose of understanding the dynamics of the model. We will necessarily end up with something that qualitatively looks like the graph in Figure 2.4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Graph of the function \\(f(N)=\\frac{bN^2}{1+N^2}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing our cobweb technique, or simply looking at the slope of \\(f\\) at the fixed points, we can easily convince ourselves that the extinction fixed point is stable, the smaller non-zero fixed point \\(N^*_-\\) is unstable and the larger fixed point \\(N^*_+\\) is stable. in Figure 2.4 we have indicated the stable fixed points by solid circles and the unstable fixed points by open circles. So when the population number is larger than \\(N^*_-\\) it will grow towards \\(N^*_+\\), and when it is smaller than \\(N^*_-\\) it will go extinct. So this model exhibits a strong Allee effect with critical depensation. \\(N^*_-\\) is the smallest viable population size.\nWe can now add harvesting to the model. The extra term in the function \\(f(N)\\) is \\(-EN\\). This lowers the graph of \\(f(N)\\) by an amount that grows linearly with \\(N\\). This is illustrated in Figure 2.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Graph of the function \\(f(N)=\\frac{bN^2}{1+N^2}-EN\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that as the harvesting effort \\(E\\) increases, the two fixed points move closer together. At a critical value \\(E_c\\) the two fixed points merge and disappear. The population number will then go extinct for all initial population numbers.\nLet us find the critical value \\(E_c\\). For that we first determine the location of the fixed points in the presence of harvesting. So we solve the equation \\[\nN^* = \\frac{b\\,{N^*}^2}{1+{N^*}^2}-EN^*.\n\\] Again this has a solution \\(N^*=0\\). We can then find the non-zero solutions by dividing both sides by \\(N^*\\) and multiply them by \\(1+{N^*}^2\\) to get the equation \\[\n(1+E){N^*}^2-bN^*+1+E = 0.\n\\] This is solved by \\[\nN^*_\\pm = \\frac{\\frac{b}{1+E}\\pm\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{b}{1+E}\\right)^2-4}}{2}.\n\\] We see that these solutions are real only if \\(\\left(\\frac{b}{1+E}\\right)^2-4\\geq 0\\), i.e., if \\(E&lt; \\frac{b-2}{2}\\). Thus the critical effort is \\(E_c=\\frac{b-2}{2}\\). Fishing above this level will lead to extinction of the population. But even fishing just near this level is risky because the population number will be very close to the minimum viable population and a small disturbance could lead to extinction.",

    "text": "2.5 Bifurcations\nA bifurcation is a change in the existence and/or stability of the fixed points as the parameters of the model are varied.\nYou have met bifurcations in continuous-time models already in your Dynamical Systems module. You have seen there that in one-dimensional systems described by a single ODE there are three different types of bifurcation: saddle-node, pitchfork, transcritical. The same types of bifurcations can occur in discrete-time models but there is also one more type: the period-doubling bifurcation.\nWe have already seen a bifurcation in the discrete-time harvesting model. The bifurcation was a saddle-node bifurcation, where two fixed points merge and disappear. This is also sometimes referred to as a tangent bifurcation, because at the critical value of the parameter the curve \\(y=f(N)\\) is tangent to the line \\(y=N\\) at the fixed point.\nIn the period-doubling bifurcation the stability of the fixed point changes as the parameter is varied. The fixed point changes from stable to unstable, and at the same time a stable period-2 orbit appears, where the population number oscillates between two values. The period-2 orbit is stable in the sense that if the population number is close to the orbit it will converge to the orbit. This kind of bifurcation can obviously not arise in one-dimensional continuous-time models because a continuous orbit can not move from one side of a fixed point to the other.\nIn the lectures we drew diagrams illustrating three of the four types of bifurcations. For a discussion of all four types in a similar fashion, you can view the following video.",

In particular, if we start with equal number females and males then the they will stay equal for all times.\nTo make further progress we need to make a concrete choice for the function \\(\\varphi(F,M)\\). We will consider the simplest possible choice \\[\n\\varphi(F,M)=F\\,M.\n\\tag{3.5}\\] This choice is motivated by the fact that both a male and a female is needed to produce offspring. So the rate of births should increase if there are more females but also when there are more males. The simplest way to capture this is to multiply \\(F\\) and \\(M\\).\nA simple thing to note is that if \\(M(0)=0\\) then \\(M(t)=0\\) for all times. Then the number of females satisfies \\[\n\\frac{dF}{dt}=-\\mu F.\n\\tag{3.6}\\] This has the solution \\[\nF(t)=F(0)e^{-\\mu t}.\n\\tag{3.7}\\] So if there are no males, the females have to die out as well.\nWe noted above that if initially \\(F(0)=M(0)\\) then \\(F(t)=M(t)\\) for all times. In that case the number of females satisfies \\[\n\\frac{dF}{dt}=-\\mu F+bF^2.\n\\tag{3.8}\\] This is illustrated in Figure 3.1.\nFigure 3.1: Quadratically increasing growth rate.\nNote that the non-zero fixed point at \\(F=\\mu/b\\) is unstable.

In fact, they grow so rapidly that the population size becomes infinite in finite time, as we can see when we solve the ODE.\nWe can solve Eq. 3.8 by separation of variables: \\[\n\\int\\frac{dF}{-\\mu F+bF^2}=\\int dt.\n\\] We could do the integral on the left hand side by partial fractions. But to see the problem of the population size becoming infinite in finite time it is sufficient to consider the case of \\(F&gt;&gt;1\\) where we can neglect the term \\(-\\mu F\\) in the denominator. Then we get \\[\n\\int_{F(0)}^{F(t)}\\frac{dF}{F^2}=\\frac{1}{F(0)}-\\frac{1}{F(t)}=\\int_0^t b\\, d\\tilde{t}=bt.\n\\] and hence \\[\nF(t)=\\frac{1}{1/F(0)-bt}.\n\\tag{3.9}\\] So the population size becomes infinite at time \\(t=1/(bF(0))\\).

This is a first-order linear ODE with time-dependent inhomogeneity. We can solve it by the method of integrating factors. We first rewrite it in the form \\[\n\\frac{dM}{dt}+\\mu_M M=b_M F_0\\,e^{(-\\mu_F+b_F)t}\n\\tag{3.14}\\] and then observe that the left-hand side is proportional to a total derivative: \\[\n\\frac{dM}{dt}+\\mu_M M=\\frac{d}{dt}(e^{\\mu_M t}M)e^{-\\mu_M t}\n\\tag{3.15}\\] Thus after multiplying both sides by \\(e^{\\mu_M t}\\) we get \\[\n\\frac{d}{dt}(e^{\\mu_M t}M)=b_M F_0\\,e^{(\\mu_M-\\mu_F+b_F)t}.\n\\tag{3.16}\\] We can now integrate both sides to get \\[\ne^{\\mu_M t}M(t)-e^{\\mu_M t}M_0=\\frac{b_M F_0}{\\mu_M-\\mu_F+b_F}\\left(e^{(\\mu_M-\\mu_F+b_F)t}-1\\right).\n\\tag{3.17}\\] This can be solved for \\(M(t)\\): \\[\nM(t)=M_0e^{-\\mu_M t}+\\frac{b_M F_0}{\\mu_M-\\mu_F+b_F}\\left(e^{(-\\mu_F+b_F)t}-e^{-\\mu_M t}\\right).\n\\tag{3.18}\\] We have been able to fully solve this model. At this stage it is worth checking that the dependence of the solution on the parameters and on the initial conditions is reasonable.\nNext let us take a look at the sex ratio as \\(t\\to\\infty\\). We find \\[\\begin{split}\ns=\\lim_{t\\to\\infty}\\frac{M(t)}{F(t)}\n&=\\lim_{t\\to\\infty}\\frac{M_0e^{-\\mu_M t}+\\frac{b_M F_0}{\\mu_M-\\mu_F+b_F}\\left(e^{(-\\mu_F+b_F)t}-e^{-\\mu_M t}\\right)}{F_0e^{(-\\mu_F+b_F)t}}\\\\\n&=\\frac{b_M}{b_F-\\mu_F+\\mu_M}.\n\\end{split} \\tag{3.19}\\]\nJust for fun let us check what this model would predict for the sex ratio in the population of the US, using data about births and deaths from 1992. \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\mu_F&=807/100,000/\\text{year}, ~~~\\mu_M=902/100,000/\\text{year},\\\\\nb_F&=1480/100,000/\\text{year}, ~~~b_M=1550/100,000/\\text{year}.\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{3.20}\\] Substituting these values into Eq. 3.19 we get \\(s \\approx 0.9841\\). The actual ratio in the US in 1992 was \\(0.953\\). Of course this is not to be taken seriously. To start with, human populations are not solely female-limited.

This gives \\[\n\\varphi(F,M)=\\frac{M}{F+M}F+\\frac{F}{F+M}M=\\frac{2FM}{F+M}.\n\\tag{3.22}\\] We can now use this in the ODEs for \\(F\\) and \\(M\\): \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\frac{dF}{dt} &= -\\mu_F F+b_F\\frac{2FM}{F+M},\\\\\n\\frac{dM}{dt} &= -\\mu_M M+b_M\\frac{2FM}{F+M}.\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{3.23}\\] We will not try to solve this coupled system of nonlinear ODEs. Instead we will directly look at the long-term sex ratio. We can derive an ODE for the sex ration \\(M/F\\): \\[\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\frac{M}{F}=\\frac{\\frac{dM}{dt}F-M\\frac{dF}{dt}}{F^2}.\n\\tag{3.24}\\] Because we are only interested in the long-term behavior we look at the fixed point of this equation, hence we set the left-hand side to zero. We then get \\[\n\\frac{dM}{dt}F-M\\frac{dF}{dt}=0.\n\\tag{3.25}\\] We can now use the ODEs for \\(F\\) and \\(M\\) to get \\[\n\\frac{dM}{dt}F-M\\frac{dF}{dt}=\\left(-\\mu_M M+b_M\\frac{2FM}{F+M}\\right)F-M\\left(-\\mu_F F+b_F\\frac{2FM}{F+M}\\right)=0.\n\\tag{3.26}\\] We multiply by \\(F+M\\) and divide by \\(FM\\) to get \\[\n-\\mu_M(F+M)+2b_MF+\\mu_F(F+M)-2b_FM=0.\n\\tag{3.27}\\] Collecting terms proportional to \\(F\\) and \\(M\\) we get \\[\n(-\\mu_M+2b_M+\\mu_F)F=(\\mu_M-\\mu_F+2b_F)M.\n\\tag{3.28}\\] We can now solve this equation for the asymptotic sex ratio \\[\ns=\\lim_{t\\to\\infty}\\frac{M(t)}{F(t)}=\\frac{\\mu_M-\\mu_F+2b_F}{-\\mu_M+2b_M+\\mu_F}.\n\\tag{3.29}\\]\nEven though the sex ratio approaches a fixed point as \\(t\\to\\infty\\), the population numbers themselves do not. Once the sex ratio has settled to the value \\(s\\), we have \\(M=sF\\) and we can use this to get a single ODE for \\(F\\): \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\frac{dF}{dt}&=-\\mu_F F+b_F\\frac{2MF}{F+M}\\\\\n&=-\\mu_F F+\\frac{2s}{s+1}b_FF.\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{3.30}\\] This is a linear equation and has the solution \\[\nF(t)=F_0e^{\\left(-\\mu_F+\\frac{2s}{s+1}b_F\\right)t}.\n\\tag{3.31}\\] Similarly we obtain \\[\nM(t)=M_0e^{(-\\mu_M+\\frac{2}{s+1}b_M)t}.\n\\tag{3.32}\\] So we have an exponential growth model for both \\(F\\) and \\(M\\), but the exponent has a modified birth rate that takes the sex ratio into account.\nTo arrive at more realistic models we should introduce a carrying capacity into the model.",

    "text": "4.1 Continuous time model\nIn the previous chapter we structured the population by a discrete variable, the sex of the individuals. This gave rise to a system of coupled ODEs, one ODE for each class of individuals. In this section we will structure the population by a continuous variable, the age of the individuals. This will give rise to a partial differential equation (PDE) for the age-dependent population density. We will solve this PDE and study the long-term behaviour of the population and its age distribution.\nSo instead of describing the population just by the total number of individuals \\(N(t)\\), we will describe it by the density \\(n(t,a)\\) of individuals at age \\(a\\). The total number \\(N(t)\\) of individuals in the population is then given by the integral of \\(n(t,a)\\) over all ages. More generally, the total number of individuals in the population that are between age \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_2\\) is given by the integral of \\(n(t,a)\\) over the interval \\([a_1,a_2]\\). You are familiar with the concept of density from probability theory, where continuous random variables are described by a probability density rather than a probability. You may also be familiar with the concept from physics, where the density of a material describes how the mass is distributed over space. Here, the density \\(n(t,a)\\) describes how the individuals are distributed over ages.\nTo derive the PDE for the age-structured population density, we consider how the density changes over an infinitesimal time interval \\(\\delta t\\) due to deaths: \\[\nn(t+\\delta t, a+\\delta t) = n(t,a) - \\mu(a) n(t,a) \\delta t.\n\\tag{4.1}\\] Note how we had to take into account that over the time interval \\(\\delta t\\) the age of the individuals has increased by \\(\\delta t\\). We now Taylor-expand the left-hand side around \\(t\\) and \\(a\\): \\[\nn(t+\\delta t, a+\\delta t) = n(t,a) + \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} \\delta t + \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial a} \\delta t + \\mathcal{O}(\\delta t^2).\n\\tag{4.2}\\] Cancelling the \\(n(t,a)\\) terms on both sides and dividing by \\(\\delta t\\) gives us the PDE for the age-structured population density: \\[\n\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial a} = -\\mu(a) n.\n\\tag{4.3}\\]\nThis equation captures the effect of individuals aging and dying, but it does not capture how they are born. Individuals are born with age \\(0\\). These offspring can be produced by parents of any ages, but with an age-dependent rate \\(b(a)\\). This gives \\[\nn(t,0) = \\int_0^\\infty b(a) n(t,a) \\, da.\n\\tag{4.4}\\] This is a boundary condition for the PDE. It says that the density of individuals at age \\(0\\) is given by the total number of offspring produced by the individuals of all ages.\nWe will now solve the PDE for the age-structured population density by the method of separation of variables. We will make the Ansatz \\(n(t,a) = f(t) r(a)\\). You have seen this trick for finding solutions of linear, homogeneous PDEs in other modules, like Waves and Fluids for example. Substituting this Ansatz into the PDE gives \\[\nf'(t) r(a) + f(t) r'(a) = -\\mu(a) f(t) r(a).\n\\tag{4.5}\\] Dividing by \\(f(t) r(a)\\) gives \\[\n\\frac{f'(t)}{f(t)} + \\frac{r'(a)}{r(a)} = -\\mu(a).\n\\tag{4.6}\\] We now collect all terms that depend on \\(t\\) on the left-hand side and all terms that depend on \\(a\\) on the right-hand side: \\[\n\\frac{f'(t)}{f(t)} = - \\frac{r'(a)}{r(a)} - \\mu(a).\n\\tag{4.7}\\] Because the left-hand side is independent of \\(a\\) and the right-hand side is independent of \\(t\\), both sides must be equal to a constant. We introduce the separation constant \\(\\gamma\\) and write \\[\n\\frac{f'(t)}{f(t)} = \\gamma, \\quad \\frac{r'(a)}{r(a)} = -\\gamma - \\mu(a).\n\\tag{4.8}\\] These are now linear ODEs and hence easy to solve. The first ODE has the solution \\[\nf(t) = f(0) e^{\\gamma t}\n\\tag{4.9}\\] and the second ODE has the solution \\[\nr(a) = r(0) \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^a \\mu(a') \\, da'-\\gamma a\\right).\n\\tag{4.10}\\]\nSo altogether we have the population density \\[\nn(t,a) = n(0,0) e^{\\gamma t} \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^a \\mu(a') \\, da'-\\gamma a\\right),\n\\tag{4.11}\\] where \\(n(0,0)=f(0)r(0)\\) is the initial density of individuals at age \\(0\\).\nSo far we don’t yet know the value of the separation constant \\(\\gamma\\). This will be determined by the boundary condition. If we substitute the solution Eq. 4.11 into the boundary condition Eq. 4.4, we get \\[\nn(0,0)e^{\\gamma t} = \\int_0^\\infty b(a) n(0,0)e^{\\gamma t} \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^a \\mu(a') \\, da'-\\gamma a\\right)\\, da.\n\\tag{4.12}\\] We can cancel the common factor \\(n(0,0)e^{\\gamma t}\\) on both sides to get the condition \\[\n1= \\int_0^\\infty b(a) \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^a \\mu(a') \\, da'-\\gamma a\\right) \\, da = \\phi(\\gamma).\n\\tag{4.13}\\] We have introduced the shorthand notation \\(\\phi(\\gamma)\\) for the integral on the right-hand side. The condition Eq. 4.12 is a transcendental equation for \\(\\gamma\\). We cannot solve it analytically for \\(\\gamma\\). But we observe that \\(\\phi\\) is a monotonically decreasing function of \\(\\gamma\\). This observation alone allows us to make a statement about the sign of \\(\\gamma\\). According to Eq. 4.9 the sign of \\(\\gamma\\) determines whether the total population grows expnentially or goes extinct.\nIf \\(\\gamma\\) is positive, then the monotonicity of \\(\\phi\\) tells us that \\(\\phi(0) &gt; \\phi(\\gamma)  = 1\\) and vice versa. Conversely, if \\(\\gamma\\) is negative, then \\(\\phi(0) &lt; \\phi(\\gamma) = 1\\) and vice versa. So to determine the sign of \\(\\gamma\\) we only have to look at the value of \\[\n\\phi(0) = \\int_0^\\infty b(a) \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^a \\mu(a') \\, da'\\right)\\, da.\n\\tag{4.14}\\]\nThis result actually has a very intuitive explanation. The factor \\[\n\\exp\\left(-\\int_0^a \\mu(a') \\, da'\\right)=:l(a)\n\\tag{4.15}\\] is the probability that an individual survives up to age \\(a\\). Therefore \\(\\phi(0)\\) is the expected number of offspring produced by an individual during its lifetime. If this number is greater than \\(1\\), then the population grows exponentially. If it is less than \\(1\\), then the population goes extinct.",

    "text": "4.2 Discrete time model\nIn the continuous-time age-structured population model discussed in the previous section we had assumed that births take place continuously through time. If however reproduction is an annual event, taking place in a short breeding season for example, then it is more natural to model the population in discrete time. We will now derive the discrete-time version of the age-structured population model and then study the long-term behaviour of the population and its age distribution.\n\n4.2.1 Model description\nBoth time and age will be discrete variables. We will take them to be integers counting years. We will describe the population by the numbers \\(N_{a,t}\\) of individuals of age \\(a\\) at time \\(t\\). The total number \\(N_t\\) of individuals in the population at time \\(t\\) is then given by the sum of \\(N_{a,t}\\) over all ages.\nThe parameters of our model will be the probabilities \\(S_a\\) of surviving from age \\(a-1\\) to age \\(a\\) and the number of offspring \\(b_a\\) produced by an individual when they reach age \\(a\\). Because the number of individuals at age \\(a\\) at time \\(t+1\\) is the number of individuals that a year earlier were at age \\(a-1\\) and have survived to age \\(a\\), we have \\[\nN_{a,t+1} = S_{a} N_{a-1,t}.\n\\tag{4.16}\\] When individuals reach age \\(a\\), they each produce \\(b_a\\) offspring. The total number of offspring produced at time \\(t\\) is therefore given by \\[\nN_{0,t} = \\sum_{a=1}^\\infty b_a N_{a,t}.\n\\tag{4.17}\\] This is a boundary condition for the discrete-time model. It says that the number of individuals at age \\(0\\) at time \\(t\\) is given by the total number of offspring produced by the individuals of all ages at time \\(t\\). This is the discrete-time analogue of the boundary condition Eq. 4.4 for the continuous-time model.\nNote that in Eq. 4.17 both sides of the equation are at time \\(t\\). That is because reproduction is taken to happen instantaneously at time \\(t\\). It is conventional to use Eq. 4.16 to rewrite the boundary condition Eq. 4.17 as an equation for \\(N_{0,t+1}\\): \\[\nN_{0,t+1} = \\sum_{a=1}^\\infty b_a N_{a,t+1}= \\sum_{a=1}^\\infty b_a S_{a} N_{a-1,t}\n= \\sum_{a=1}^\\infty F_a N_{a-1,t},\n\\tag{4.18}\\] where we have introduced the fecundity \\(F_a:=b_a S_a\\).\nEq. 4.16 and Eq. 4.18 are the equations for the discrete-time age-structured population model. They are a system of coupled difference equations, one equation for each age class. We would like to solve them to determine the numbers \\(N_{a,t}\\) of individuals at each age at each time. Notice that Eq. 4.16 looks very simple and we could use it to determine \\(N_{a,t}\\) for \\(a=1,2,3,\\ldots\\) in terms of \\(N_{0,t}\\), \\[\n\\begin{split}\nN_{a,t} &= S_{a} N_{a-1,t} = S_{a} S_{a-1} N_{a-2,t} = \\cdots \\\\\n&= S_aS_{a-1}\\cdots S_1 N_{0,t}\n= l_{a} N_{0,t},\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{4.19}\\] where we used that the product \\(S_aS_{a-1}\\cdots S_1\\) is the probability of surviving from age \\(0\\) to age \\(a\\), which we denote by \\(l_a\\). However Eq. 4.18 spoils the game because it tells us that we won’t know \\(N_{0,t}\\) until we know \\(N_{a,t}\\) for all ages \\(a\\). This is a typical feature of age-structured population models. The number of individuals at age \\(0\\) at time \\(t\\) depends on the number of individuals at all other ages at time \\(t\\). Solving both Eq. 4.16 and Eq. 4.18 together is a non-trivial task.\n\n\n4.2.2 Stable age distribution\nIn analogy to the continuous-time model, we will now look for a solution of the form \\[\nN_{a,t} = \\lambda^t r(a)\n\\tag{4.20}\\] This is a solution in which the age distribution \\(r(a)\\) remains stable from one year to the next, but the total population grows or shrinks by a factor \\(\\lambda\\) each year. This means in particular that for this solution \\(N_{a,t+1} = \\lambda N_{a,t}\\) for all ages \\(a\\). For \\(a=1\\) this gives \\[\nN_{1,t+1} = \\lambda N_{1,t} = S_1 N_{0,t}\n\\tag{4.21}\\] and hence \\[\nN_{1,t} = \\frac{S_1}{\\lambda} N_{0,t}.\n\\tag{4.22}\\] Similarly we can express \\(N_{2,t}\\) in terms of \\(N_{0,t}\\): \\[\nN_{2,t} = \\frac{S_2}{\\lambda} N_{1,t} = \\frac{S_1 S_2}{\\lambda^2} N_{0,t}.\n\\tag{4.23}\\] We can continue this process to express \\(N_{a,t}\\) in terms of \\(N_{0,t}\\): \\[\nN_{a,t} = \\frac{S_1 S_2 \\cdots S_{a}}{\\lambda^a} N_{0,t}= \\frac{l_{a}}{\\lambda^a} N_{0,t}.\n\\tag{4.24}\\]\nFinally, for the newborns we have \\[\nN_{0,t+1} = \\lambda N_{0,t} = \\sum_{a=1}^M F_a N_{a-1,t} = \\sum_{a=1}^M F_a \\frac{l_{a-1}}{\\lambda^{a-1}} N_{0,t}.\n\\tag{4.25}\\] Dividing the equation by \\(\\lambda N_{0,t}\\) gives \\[\n1 = \\sum_{a=1}^M F_a\\frac{l_{a-1}}{\\lambda^a}.\n\\tag{4.26}\\] Using that \\(F_a = b_a S_a\\) and \\(S_al_{a-1}=l_a\\) we can rewrite this equation as \\[\n1 = \\sum_{a=1}^M b_a \\,l_a\\,\\lambda^{-a} =:\\psi(\\lambda).\n\\tag{4.27}\\] This is the Euler-Lotka equation for the stable age distribution. Compare it to the corresponding equation for the continuous-time model Eq. 4.13 with \\(e^{\\gamma}=\\lambda\\). The only difference is that the continuous-time model has an integral over age, while the discrete-time model has a sum over age.\nBy the same argument as in the continuous case we can see that if the expected number of offspring produced by an individual during its lifetime, \\(\\sum_{a=1}^M b_a \\,l_a=\\psi(1)\\), is greater than \\(1\\) then the population grows exponentially. If it is less than \\(1\\), then the population goes extinct.\nWe will now determine the stable age distribution for a specific example.\n\nExample 4.1 For the spotted owl the age-dependent reproduction numbers are \\[\nb_a = \\begin{cases}\n0 & \\text{if } a &lt; 2, \\\\\nb & \\text{if } a \\geq 2\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{4.28}\\] for some constant \\(b\\). The age-dependent survival probabilities are \\[\nS_a = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if } a = 1, \\\\\nl & \\text{if } a = 2, \\\\\np & \\text{if } a &gt; 2\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{4.29}\\] for some constants \\(l\\) and \\(p\\). Those values of the survival probabilities from year to year lead to the following values of the survival probabilities from birth to age \\(a\\): \\[\nl_a = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if } a = 1, \\\\\nl\\, p^{a-2} & \\text{if } a \\geq 2.\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{4.30}\\] Substituting these values into the expression for \\(\\psi(\\lambda)\\) in Eq. 4.44 gives \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\psi(\\lambda) &= b l \\sum_{a=2}^\\infty p^{a-2} \\lambda^{-a} = lb\\lambda^{-2}\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{p}{\\lambda}\\\\\n&= lb\\lambda^{-2}\\frac{1}{1-\\frac{p}{\\lambda}}\n=\\frac{lb}{\\lambda(\\lambda-p)},\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{4.31}\\] where we made use of the formula for a geometric series, valid if \\(|p/\\lambda|&lt;1\\) 1. In particular, the expected number of offspring produced by an individual in their lifetime is \\[\n\\psi(1)=lb/(1-p).\n\\] If this is greater than \\(1\\), then the population grows exponentially. If it is less than \\(1\\), then the population goes extinct.\nIn this case the Euler-Lotka equation \\(\\psi(\\lambda)=1\\) becomes the quadratic equation for \\(\\lambda\\): \\[\n\\psi(\\lambda)=\\frac{lb}{\\lambda(\\lambda-p)}=1 \\quad \\Leftrightarrow \\quad \\lambda^2 - \\lambda p - lb = 0.\n\\tag{4.32}\\] The solutions are \\[\n\\lambda_\\pm = \\frac{p \\pm \\sqrt{p^2 + 4lb}}{2}.\n\\tag{4.33}\\] We are interested in the positive solution \\(\\lambda_+\\). Substituting this value for \\(\\lambda\\) back into Eq. 4.42 and Eq. 4.20 we see that we have found the solution \\[\nN_{a,t} = \\left(\\frac{p + \\sqrt{p^2 + 4lb}}{2}\\right)^{t-a}l_a N_{0,0}\n\\tag{4.34}\\] for any choice of \\(N_{0,0}\\).\n\n\n\n4.2.3 Leslie matrix\nIn the case where there is a maximal age \\(m\\) beyond which there is no reproduction, either because \\(b_a = 0\\) for \\(a&gt;m\\) or because there are not older individuals because \\(S_{m+1} = 0\\), we can then collect the equations for \\(N_{a,t+1}\\) for \\(a=0,1,2,\\ldots,m-1\\) (Eq. 4.16 and Eq. 4.18) into a matrix equation:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nN_{0} \\\\\nN_{1} \\\\\nN_{2} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nN_{m-1}\n\\end{pmatrix}_{t+1}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nF_0 & F_2 & \\cdots & F_{m-2} & F_{m-1} \\\\\nS_1 & 0 & \\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & S_2 & \\cdots & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\cdots & S_{m-1} & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nN_{0} \\\\\nN_{1} \\\\\nN_{2} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nN_{m-1}\n\\end{pmatrix}_{t}.\n\\tag{4.35}\\]\nNote that we did not need to include the equation for \\(N_{m,t+1}\\) in the matrix equation because \\(N_{m,t+1}\\) is not needed to calculate the reproduction. Once the matrix equation Eq. 4.35 is solved, we can determine \\(N_{m,t+1}\\) separately from Eq. 4.16 if we are interested, and similarly for all older age classes that do not reproduce, if any.\nThe matrix on the right-hand side of Eq. 4.35 is a so-called Leslie matrix. Let us denote it by \\(L\\). The equation Eq. 4.35 is a matrix equation of the form \\[\n\\mathbf{N}_{t+1} = L\\, \\mathbf{N}_t,\n\\tag{4.36}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{N}_t\\) is the column vector of the numbers \\(N_{a,t}\\) and \\(L\\) is the Leslie matrix.\nWe now have the task of solving the homogeneous linear difference equation Eq. 4.36 with constant coefficients (the Leslie matrix \\(L\\) does not depend on time). You know from earlier modules that when confronted with a homogeneous linear differential equation with constant coefficients you can solve it with an exponential Ansatz. The same works for linear difference equations. We make the Ansatz \\[\n\\mathbf{N}_t = \\lambda^t \\mathbf{v}\n\\tag{4.37}\\] and substitute it into Eq. 4.36. This gives \\[\n\\lambda^{t+1} \\mathbf{v} = L \\lambda^t \\mathbf{v}.\n\\tag{4.38}\\] Dividing by \\(\\lambda^t\\) gives \\[\n\\lambda \\mathbf{v} = L \\mathbf{v}.\n\\tag{4.39}\\] This means that our Ansatz works if we choose \\(\\lambda\\) to be an eigenvalue of the Leslie matrix \\(L\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) to be the corresponding eigenvector.\nIn the case where all eigenvalues of the Leslie matrix are distinct2, the general solution is the linear combination of the solutions for each eigenvalue. \\[\n\\mathbf{N}_t = c_1 \\lambda_1^t \\mathbf{v}_1 + c_2 \\lambda_2^t \\mathbf{v}_2 + \\cdots + c_m \\lambda_m^t \\mathbf{v}_m,\n\\tag{4.40}\\] where \\(\\lambda_1,\\lambda_2,\\ldots,\\lambda_m\\) are the eigenvalues of the Leslie matrix and \\(\\mathbf{v}_1,\\mathbf{v}_2,\\ldots,\\mathbf{v}_m\\) are the corresponding eigenvectors. The constants \\(c_1,c_2,\\ldots,c_m\\) are determined by the initial conditions.\n\nExample 4.2 Consider a population with the reproduction numbers \\(b_a\\) and the survival probabilities \\(S_a\\) given in the following table:\n\n\n\n\\(a\\)\n\\(b_a\\)\n\\(S_a\\)\n\\(F_a\\)\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\n—\n0\n\n\n1\n0\n1\n1/2\n\n\n2\n1\n1/2\n1\n\n\n3\n2\n1/2\n0\n\n\n4\n0\n1/2\n0\n\n\n\nThe final column in that table is calculated from the previous ones using \\(F_a:=b_{a+1}S_{a+1}\\). In this example the maximum age \\(m\\) beyond which there is no reproduction is \\(m=3\\). Hence the corresponding Leslie matrix is a \\(3\\times 3\\) matrix. It is given by \\[\nL = \\begin{pmatrix}\nF_0&F_1&F_2 \\\\\nS_1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & S_2 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1/2 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1/2 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\tag{4.41}\\]\nAssume that the at time \\(t=0\\) we only have 10 individuals all of age 0, i.e., \\[\n\\mathbf{N}_0 = \\begin{pmatrix}\n10 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\tag{4.42}\\] We can then calculate the numbers at the following times \\(t=1,2,3,\\ldots\\) by repeated multiplication by the Leslie matrix \\(L\\): \\[\n\\mathbf{N}_1 = L \\mathbf{N}_0 = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1/2 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1/2 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n10 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 \\\\\n10 \\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix},\n\\] \\[\n\\mathbf{N}_2 = L \\mathbf{N}_1\n= \\begin{pmatrix}\n5 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n5\n\\end{pmatrix},\n~~~\n\\mathbf{N}_3 = L \\mathbf{N}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix}\n5 \\\\\n5 \\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}, \\cdots.\n\\] Continuing like this (using a computer) we observe that the population converges to a stable age distribution. \\[\n\\lim_{t\\to\\infty}\\mathbf{N}_t = \\begin{pmatrix}\n4 \\\\\n4 \\\\\n2\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\tag{4.43}\\]\nTo understand this phenomenon we look for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Leslie matrix. The eigenvalues are the solutions of the characteristic equation \\[\n\\begin{split}\n0&=\\det(L-\\lambda I)=\\begin{vmatrix}\n-\\lambda & 1/2 & 1 \\\\\n1 & -\\lambda & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1/2 & -\\lambda\n\\end{vmatrix}\n= -\\lambda^3 + \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda+\\frac12\\\\\n&= (1-\\lambda)\\left(\\lambda^2+\\lambda+\\frac12\\right)\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{4.44}\\] We can read off that the solutions are \\[\n\\lambda_) = 1, \\quad \\lambda_\\pm = -\\frac{1}{2} \\pm \\frac{1}{2}i.\n\\tag{4.45}\\] Because the magnitude of the eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_\\pm\\) is less than \\(1\\), we have that \\(\\lim_{t\\to\\infty}\\lambda_\\pm^t=0\\). This means that the stable age distribution is given by the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \\(\\lambda_0=1\\): \\[\n\\lim_{t\\to\\infty}\\mathbf{N}_t = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty}\\left(c_0 \\lambda_0^t \\mathbf{v}_0 + c_+ \\lambda_+^t \\mathbf{v}_+ + c_- \\lambda_-^t \\mathbf{v}_-\\right) = c_0 \\mathbf{v}_0.\n\\]\n\nIn general, if the Leslie matrix has a unique dominatn eigenvalue \\(\\lambda_0\\) with a corresponding eigenvector \\(\\mathbf{v}_0\\), then \\[\n\\lim_{t\\to\\infty}\\frac{\\mathbf{N}_t}{\\lambda_0^t} = c_0 \\mathbf{v}_0,\n\\] where \\(c_0\\) is a constant that depends on the initial conditions. This means that the population converges to a stable age distribution. The stable age distribution is given by the eigenvector corresponding to the dominant eigenvalue of the Leslie matrix.\nLuckily, there is a theorem about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of non-negative matrices that we can use to determine whether a Leslie matrix has a unique dominant eigenvalue. We start by associating the Leslie matrix with a directed graph. The graph has \\(m\\) vertices and a directed edge from vertex \\(i\\) to vertex \\(j\\) if and only if the Leslie matrix has a non-zero entry in column \\(i\\) and row \\(j\\). The graph is called the Leslie graph. We call the Leslie matrix irreducible if its Leslie graph is strongly connected, which means that there is a directed path between any two nodes. We call the Leslie matrix primitive if the greatest common divisor of the lengths of all circuits in the Leslie graph is \\(1\\). The following theorem is then true:\n\nTheorem 4.1 If the Leslie matrix is irreducible and primitive, then it has a unique dominant eigenvalue that is real and positive. The corresponding right eigenvector is real and strictly positive.\n\nThis is a special case of the Perron-Frobenius theorem, which is a general theorem about non-negative matrices, and is used extensively in the theory of Markov chains. The above theorem is exactly what we need, because it tells us when the Leslie matrix has a unique dominant eigenvalue and a corresponding eigenvector that gives the stable age distribution.",

It is a cavity-nesting bird, which means that it nests in holes in trees. It is able to adapt to diverse habitats, including wooded residential neighbourhoods and parks in suburban areas. In suburban areas, these owls find a variety of nesting opportunities, such as tree cavities, nest boxes, and even abandoned buildings, which may be less available in intensively farmed rural areas or dense forests. Additionally, the suburban settings can offer a rich supply of prey, including insects, small mammals, and other small creatures, partly due to the lower prevalence of large predators.\nBelow is a life table collected for two different habitats, suburban and rural, in Texas.\n\n\n\nAge\nSuburban\n\nRural\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(a\\)\n\\(l_a\\)\n\\(b_a\\)\n\\(l_a\\)\n\\(b_a\\)\n\n\n0\n1.00\n0.0\n1.00\n0.0\n\n\n1\n0.49\n0.8\n0.30\n0.8\n\n\n2\n0.18\n1.3\n0.11\n1.1\n\n\n3\n0.10\n1.5\n0.06\n1.6\n\n\n4\n0.06\n1.6\n0.04\n1.0\n\n\n5\n0.04\n1.3\n0.02\n1.0\n\n\n6\n0.03\n1.3\n\n\n\n\n7\n0.02\n1.3\n\n\n\n\n8\n0.02\n1.3\n\n\n\n\n9\n0.01\n1.3\n\n\n\n\n10\n0.01\n1.3\n\n\n\n\n\nFor each of the two populations do the following:\n\nCalculate the reproductive number, i.e., the expected number of offspring produced by a single individual during its lifetime.\nCalculate the Leslie matrix.

    "text": "5.1 Lotka-Volterra Model\nThe Lotka-Volterra model, developed independently by Alfred Lotka in 1925 and Vito Volterra in 1926, serves as a foundational mathematical model for understanding the dynamic interplay between a prey population (denoted by \\(N\\)) and a predator population (denoted by \\(P\\)).\nModel Formulation\nThe model assumes that the prey population, in the absence of predators, grows exponentially with a per capita growth rate \\(a &gt; 0\\). However, the prey die due to being eaten by predators, and we assume that the per-capita mortality rate grows in proportion to the abundance of predators, with some proportionality constant \\(b \\geq 0\\). This leads to the equation \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = N(a - bP).\n\\]\nConversely, the predators benefit from the abundance of prey and we encode that by giving them a per-capita growth \\(cN\\), where \\(c \\geq 0\\). We assume that the per capita mortality rate is a constant \\(d\\). This yields the following equation for the predator dynamics: \\[\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = P(cN - d).\n\\]\nThe two plots in Figure 5.1 generated from the Lotka-Volterra model provide a visual representation of the dynamics between a predator and prey population over time. The phase plane plot illustrates the cyclic nature of the interaction between the prey (N) and predator (P) populations, depicting a closed trajectory that indicates the continuous oscillation of both populations in relation to each other: as the prey population increases, it provides more food for the predators, which then also increase in number. However, as the predator population grows, it puts more pressure on the prey, leading to a decline in the prey population, which eventually causes the predator population to decrease due to lack of food.\nThe plot at the bottom shows the prey and predator populations over time. It highlights the periodic rises and falls of each population, showing how the increase in the prey population precedes the increase in the predator population, followed by a subsequent decline in the prey and then the predator population. The time series plot complements the phase plane by showing how the dynamics unfold over time.\nFigure 5.1: Solutions to the Lotka-Volterra model with parameters \\(a = 1.0\\), \\(b = 0.1\\), \\(c = 0.1\\), and \\(d = 1.0\\) and initial conditions \\(N_0 = 10\\) and \\(P_0 = 5\\).\nNon-dimensionalization of the Model\nNon-dimensionalization is a crucial step to reduce the complexity of the model by decreasing the number of parameters, thereby simplifying the analysis. By introducing the non-dimensional variables \\(u = \\frac{cN}{d}\\), \\(v = \\frac{bP}{a}\\), and the non-dimensional time \\(\\tau = at\\), along with the parameter \\(\\alpha = \\frac{d}{a}\\), we can transform the Lotka-Volterra equations into a more tractable form:\n\\[\n\\frac{du}{d\\tau} = u(1 - v), \\quad \\frac{dv}{d\\tau} = \\alpha v(u - 1).\n\\]\nPhase plane paths\nTo determine the phase plane paths we consider \\(v\\) as a function of \\(u\\) which satisfies the equation \\[\n\\frac{dv}{du} = \\frac{\\frac{dv}{d\\tau}}{\\frac{du}{d\\tau}} = \\frac{\\alpha v(u - 1)}{u(1 - v)}.\n\\] We rewrite this by separating the variable and integrate: \\[\n\\int\\frac{1-v}{v}dv = \\alpha \\int\\frac{u-1}{u}du.\n\\] This gives \\[\n\\log v - v = \\alpha (u - \\log u) + \\text{constant}.\n\\] So even though \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) are changing with time, this particular combination stays constant. This is a conserved quantity. Let us suggestively call the constant of the motion \\(H\\) for Hamiltonian and write it in terms of new variables \\(p = \\log u\\) and \\(q = \\log v\\): \\[\nH(q,p)= v- \\log v + \\alpha (u - \\log u) = e^q - q + \\alpha(e^p - p).\n\\] Hamilton’s equations \\[\\dot{q} = \\frac{dH}{dp},~~~~\\dot{p} = -\\frac{dH}{dq}\\] then reproduce our equations of motion.\nThis formulation underscores the conservative nature of the model, where the energy-like quantity \\(H\\) is conserved, leading to neutrally stable periodic orbits. This Hamiltonian nature is a rather special feature of the Lotka-Volterra model. Any slight modification of the model will destroy the conserved quantity and the periodic orbits. Thus we should not expect to see such perfect periodic predator-prey cycles in nature. We will discuss more realistic predator-prey models later.",

    "section": "5.2 Linear Stability Analysis",
    "text": "5.2 Linear Stability Analysis\nBefore we study more realistic models, we revisit the concept of linear stability analysis, an essential tool in understanding the dynamics near the fixed points of systems described by autonomous coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of the form\n\\[\n\\frac{dX}{dt} = f(X,Y), \\quad \\frac{dY}{dt} = g(X,Y).\n\\]\nLet us denote the fixed points (stable states) of the system as \\((x^*, y^*)\\). They satisfy \\(f(x^*, y^*) = 0\\) and \\(g(x^*, y^*) = 0\\).\nLinearization around the Fixed Points\nTo analyze the stability of these fixed points, we introduce small perturbations \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) around them, setting \\(X = x^* + x\\) and \\(Y = y^* + y\\). By applying a Taylor expansion and retaining only the linear terms, we obtain a linearized system:\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{A}(x^*, y^*) \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix},\n\\]\nwhere the Jacobian matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is defined as:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} f_X & f_Y \\\\ g_X & g_Y \\end{pmatrix}_{(x^*, y^*)}.\n\\]\nEigenvalue Analysis for Stability\nThe solution to the linearized system takes the form \\((x, y) = \\mathbf{v} e^{\\lambda t}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is an eigenvector of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), and \\(\\lambda\\) is the corresponding eigenvalue. By setting the determinant of \\(\\mathbf{A} - \\lambda \\mathbf{I}\\) to zero, we obtain the characteristic equation:\n\\[\n\\det(\\mathbf{A} - \\lambda \\mathbf{I}) = \\begin{vmatrix} f_X - \\lambda & f_Y \\\\ g_X & g_Y - \\lambda \\end{vmatrix}_{(x^*, y^*)} = 0,\n\\]\nwhich leads to the eigenvalues:\n\\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{\\text{Tr} \\mathbf{A} \\pm \\sqrt{(\\text{Tr} \\mathbf{A})^2 - 4\\det \\mathbf{A}}}{2}.\n\\]\nThe stability of the fixed point is determined by the sign of the real parts of the eigenvalues:\n\nIf both eigenvalues have negative real parts, the fixed point is stable (attracting).\nIf both eigenvalues have positive real parts, the fixed point is unstable (repelling).\nIf the eigenvalues have real parts of opposite signs, the fixed point is a saddle point, which is unstable.\nFor a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues, if the real part is positive, the system exhibits an unstable spiral; if the real part is negative, the system exhibits a stable spiral.\n\nThis analysis is pivotal for understanding how small deviations from equilibrium evolve over time, providing insights into the system’s long-term behavior near the fixed points. For instance, in the context of the predator-prey dynamics, such analysis helps elucidate under what conditions the populations will return to equilibrium after a disturbance or potentially diverge away from it.\nWe can reformulate the stability conditions of a fixed point in terms of the determinant and trace of the Jacobian matrix. We need to recall how these two characteristics of the Jacobian relate to the eigenvalues. For a 2x2 matrix \\(A\\) with eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_1\\) and \\(\\lambda_2\\), the trace \\(\\text{Tr}(A)\\) is the sum of the eigenvalues, and the determinant \\(\\text{Det}(A)\\) is the product of the eigenvalues:\n\n\\(\\text{Tr}(A) = \\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2\\)\n\\(\\text{Det}(A) = \\lambda_1 \\lambda_2\\)\n\nUsing these relationships, we can express the conditions for the stability of fixed points as follows:\n\nStable (Attracting) Fixed Point: If both eigenvalues have negative real parts, their sum (the trace) is negative, and their product (the determinant) is positive because the product of two negative numbers is positive. Therefore, for stability, \\(\\text{Tr}(A) &lt; 0\\) and \\(\\text{Det}(A) &gt; 0\\). Additionally, to ensure that both eigenvalues are real and negative, we require that \\(\\text{Tr}(A)^2 - 4\\text{Det}(A) \\geq 0\\) to avoid complex eigenvalues.\nUnstable (Repelling) Fixed Point: If both eigenvalues have positive real parts, the trace is positive, and the determinant is positive (the product of two positive numbers is positive). Thus, for instability, \\(\\text{Tr}(A) &gt; 0\\) and \\(\\text{Det}(A) &gt; 0\\).\nSaddle Point (Unstable): If the eigenvalues have real parts of opposite signs, the determinant (the product of the eigenvalues) is negative. So, for a saddle point, \\(\\text{Det}(A) &lt; 0\\), regardless of the trace.\nSpiral Points: For a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues, the determinant will be positive (since the product of complex conjugates is positive), but the stability depends on the sign of the real part of the eigenvalues, which is represented by the trace. Here, we also need to ensure that \\(\\text{Tr}(A)^2 - 4\\text{Det}(A) &lt; 0\\) to confirm that the eigenvalues are complex.\n\nUnstable Spiral: If the real part is positive, \\(\\text{Tr}(A) &gt; 0\\) and \\(\\text{Det}(A) &gt; 0\\).\nStable Spiral: If the real part is negative, \\(\\text{Tr}(A) &lt; 0\\) and \\(\\text{Det}(A) &gt; 0\\).\n\n\nThese conditions provide a concise way to determine the stability of fixed points using only the determinant and trace of the Jacobian matrix, without explicitly computing the eigenvalues.\n\nExample 5.1 (Linear Stability Analysis of the Lotka-Volterra Model) To explore the stability of steady states in the Lotka-Volterra model, we analyze the system near its fixed points using the Jacobian matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\). For the non-dimensionalized Lotka-Volterra system, the Jacobian matrix is given by \\[\n\\mathbf{A} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 - v & -u \\\\\n\\alpha v & \\alpha (u - 1)\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nSteady State at \\((u, v) = (0, 0)\\)\nFor the fixed point \\((u, v) = (0, 0)\\), we substitute these values into the Jacobian matrix and find the eigenvalues:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{A} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -\\alpha\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nThe eigenvalues are \\(\\lambda_1 = 1\\) and \\(\\lambda_2 = -\\alpha\\), indicating that this fixed point is a saddle point due to the eigenvalues having opposite signs. This configuration is inherently unstable as trajectories near the point will diverge away along the direction associated with the positive eigenvalue.\nSteady State at \\((u, v) = (1, 1)\\)\nAt the fixed point \\((u, v) = (1, 1)\\), the Jacobian matrix becomes:\n\\[\n\\mathbf{A} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -1 \\\\\n\\alpha & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nThe characteristic equation for the eigenvalues \\(\\lambda\\) is \\(\\lambda^2 + \\alpha = 0\\), leading to complex eigenvalues \\(\\lambda = \\pm i\\sqrt{\\alpha}\\). The real part of these eigenvalues is zero, indicating that this fixed point is a center. Trajectories around this point are closed loops, implying that the system exhibits neutrally stable periodic behavior around the \\((1, 1)\\) steady state.\nThe period \\(T\\) of the oscillations can be determined from the imaginary part of the eigenvalues, which is \\(\\sqrt{\\alpha}\\), so the period \\(T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}}\\).",

If \\(u(0)=u_0\\) then \\(A=\\alpha -\\beta u_0\\).\nTranslating back to \\(w\\) with \\(w_0=u_0^3\\) we finally have \\[\nw(t) = u(t)^3 = \\frac{1}{\\beta^3}\\left( \\alpha - \\left( \\alpha - \\beta w_0^{1/3} \\right) e^{-\\beta t/3}  \\right)^3.\n\\]\n\n\n\nExercise 1.3\nSolving logistic equation\nWe separate the variables by dividing both sides of the ODE by \\(N(1-N/K)\\) and multiplying by \\(dt\\), and then integrate to get \\[\n\\int_{N_0}^{N(t)}\\frac{dN}{N\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K}\\right)}=\\int_0^t r\\,dt.\\] The right hand side is trivial to integrate, but for the integral on the left-hand side we need to employ the method of partial fractions, using that \\[\\frac{dN}{N\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K}\\right)}=\\frac{1}{N}+\\frac{1}{K-N}.\\] The left-hand side then gives \\[\n\\int_{N_0}^{N(t)}\\left(\\frac{1}{N}+\\frac{1}{K-N(t)}\\right)dN=\\log N(t)-\\log N_0-\\log(K-N(t))+\\log(K-N_0).\\] We exponentiate both sides to get \\[\\frac{N(t)}{N_0}\\frac{K-N_0}{K-N(t)}=e^{rt}.\\] Now we just need to solve for \\(N(t)\\): \\[N(t)=\\frac{N_0Ke^{rt}}{K+N_0(e^{rt}-1)}.\\]\n\n\n\nExercise 1.5\nHarvesting with fixed quota\nIf we harvest with a fixed quota \\(Q\\), the population is described by the equation \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = \\alpha N \\log\\frac{K}{N} - Q.\n\\] The subtraction of \\(Q\\) shifts the graph of the right-hand side down by a distance \\(Q\\). This brings the non-zero fixed points closer together until \\(Q\\) is equal to the maximum of the growth rate of the unfished population. If \\(Q\\) is increased beyond this value the non-zero fixed points disappear and the population will go extinct. is because we are removing \\(Q\\) individuals from the population at a constant rate. Thus the maximum sustainable yield occurs when \\(Q\\) equals the maximum replenishment rate of the unfished population. To find that maximum we first solve \\[\n0=\\frac{d}{dN}\\left(\\alpha N \\log\\frac{K}{N}\\right)=\\alpha\\left(\\log\\frac{K}{N}-1\\right).\n\\] This tells us that the maximum is at \\[\nN_{max} = K\\,e^{-1}.\n\\] Hence the value at the maximum is \\[MSY=Q_{max}=\\alpha N_{max} \\log\\frac{K}{N_{max}}=\\alpha\\,K\\,e^{-1}.\\] Fishing at this quota is not wise, as this reduces the population to the threshold level below which the population will go extinct.\n\n\nExercise 1.6\nWasps\nFor \\(0\\leq t\\leq t_c\\) the number of workers satisfies \\[\n\\frac{dn}{dt}=r\\,n.\n\\] Therefore \\[\nn(t)=n_0e^{r\\,t}.\n\\]\nFor \\(t_c\\leq t\\leq T\\) the number of reproducers satisfies \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt}=Rn(t_c)=R\\,n_0\\,e^{r\\,t_c},\n\\] so that \\[\nN(T)=(T-t_c)R\\,e^{r\\,t_c}.\n\\]\nTo find the value of \\(t_c\\) that maximises \\(N(T)\\) we set the derivative of \\(N(T)\\) with respect to \\(t_c\\) to zero: \\[\n0=\\frac{d}{dt_c}N(T)=\\frac{d}{dt_c}(T-t_c)R\\,e^{r\\,t_c}=-R\\,e^{r\\,t_c}+(T-t_c)R\\,r\\,e^{r\\,t_c}\n=R\\,e^{r\\,t_c}(r\\,T-r\\,t_c-1).\n\\] This implies that \\[\nt_c=T-\\frac{1}{r}.\n\\]\n\n\nExercise 1.7\nWasp with death\nFor \\(0\\leq t\\leq t_c\\) the number of workers satisfies \\[\\frac{dn}{dt}=(r-d)n.\\] Therefore \\[n(t)=e^{(r-d)t}.\\] For \\(t_c\\leq t\\leq T\\) we have \\[\\frac{dn}{dt}=-dn\\] so that \\[n(t)=n(t_c)e^{-d(t-t_c)}=e^{(r-d)t}e^{-d(t-t_c)}=e^{r\\,t_c}e^{-d\\,t}.\\] Also for \\(t_c\\leq t\\leq T\\) the number of reproducers satisfies \\[\\frac{dN}{dt}=Rn(t)=Re^{r\\,t_c}e^{-d\\,t},\\] so that \\[N(T)=\\int_{t_c}^TRe^{r\\,t_c}e^{-d\\,t}dt = \\frac{R}{d}e^{r\\,t_c}\\left(e^{-d\\,t_c}-e^{-d\\,T}\\right).\\] To find the value of \\(t_c\\) that maximises \\(N(T)\\) we set the derivative of \\(N(T)\\) with respect to \\(t_c\\) to zero: \\[0=\\frac{d}{dt_c}N(T)=\\frac{d}{dt_c}\\left( \\frac{R}{d}e^{r\\,t_c}\\left(e^{-d\\,t_c}-e^{-d\\,T}\\right)\\right)\n=Re^{r\\,t_c}\\left(\\left(\\frac{r}{d}-1\\right)e^{-d\\,t_c}-\\frac{r}{d}e^{-d\\,T}\\right)\\] This is equivalent to \\[e^{-d\\,t_c}=\\frac{1}{1-d/r}e^{-d\\,T}\\] and thus \\[t_c=T+\\frac{1}{d}\\ln\\left(1-\\frac{d}{r}\\right).\\]",

    "text": "5.3 More Realistic Predator-Prey Models\nWhile the basic Lotka-Volterra model provides a fundamental understanding of predator-prey interactions, more nuanced models incorporate additional biological realism. These models may account for factors like limited resources, satiation, prey switching, predator avoidance, and many others.\n\n5.3.1 Generalized Predator-Prey Model\nThe generalized model introduces a function \\(F(N, P)\\) representing the prey population’s per-capita growth and a function \\(G(N, P)\\) for the predator’s per-capita growth rate, so that the dynamics are:\n\\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = NF(N, P), \\quad \\frac{dP}{dt} = PG(N, P).\n\\]\nThe prey might exhibit logistic growth in the absence of predators. To model this we could choose\n\\[\nF(N, P) = r\\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right) - R(N)P,\n\\]\nwhere \\(R(N)\\) models how the predation rate of a predator change with the prey population size. \\(NR(N)\\) is the rate at which each individual predator consumes prey. The dependence of this rate on the prey population size \\(N\\) is often referred to as “functional response” in the ecological literature. Holling introduced three types of functional responses, which are widely used in predator-prey models:\n\nHolling Type functional responses\n\nType I \\(NR(N) = bN\\), which corresponds to the standard Lotka-Volterra model. This simplification lacks realism as it assumes an unlimited predator appetite regardless of prey population size.\nType II \\(NR(N) = \\frac{AN}{N + B}\\), with \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) being positive constants. In this model, the rate approaches a saturation level \\(A\\) for large \\(N\\), reflecting a limit to the predator’s consumption rate. This model is more realistic as it accounts for the predator’s limited appetite, which might be because there is a minimum handling time, the time the predator needs to consume a prey item.\nType III \\(R(N) = \\frac{AN^2}{N^2 + B^2}\\). This response includes a saturation effect like the previous example but also models that if the prey is rare the predator may not be able to find it. This model is more complex and captures the idea that predators may switch to alternative prey when the primary prey is scarce. It may also encode a learning effect, where the predator’s efficiency in capturing prey increases with experience so that initially the predator’s consumption rate increases with prey density.\n\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Example\nConsider a model where the prey growth rate follows logistic dynamics in the absence of prey and predation mortality is described by a Holling type II function encoding satiation effects. The predator’s growth rate goes down as the prey population decreases. The model equations are:\n\\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = N\\left[r\\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right) - \\frac{A}{N + B}P\\right], \\quad \\frac{dP}{dt} = Ps\\left(1 - \\frac{hP}{N}\\right),\n\\]\nwhere \\(r\\), \\(K\\), \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(s\\), and \\(h\\) are positive constants.\nNondimensionalization\nTo reduce the complexity, we nondimensionalize the system with \\(\\tau = tr\\), \\(u = \\frac{N}{K}\\), \\(v = \\frac{hP}{K}\\), \\(a = \\frac{A}{hr}\\), \\(b = \\frac{B}{K}\\), and \\(c = \\frac{s}{r}\\), leading to:\n\\[\n\\frac{du}{d\\tau} = u(1 - u) - a\\frac{uv}{u + b}, \\quad \\frac{dv}{d\\tau} = cv\\left(1 - \\frac{v}{u}\\right).\n\\]\nStability Analysis of Steady States\nThe steady states \\((u^*, v^*)\\) include \\((1, 0)\\) and a coexistence steady state \\((u^*_+, u^*_+)\\), where \\[u^*_+ = \\frac{1-a-b+\\sqrt{(1-a-b)^2+4b}}{2}.\\] The community matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}(u, v)\\) at these points helps determine their stability. For the fixed point \\((1, 0)\\), where the prey population is at carrying capacity and there are no predators, we have find \\[\\mathbf{A}(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -\\frac{a}{1 + b} \\\\ 0 & c \\end{pmatrix}.\\] The eigenvalues \\(-1\\) and \\(c\\) have opposite sign, indicating that the fixed point is a saddle point.\nAt the coexistence fixed point \\((u^*_+, u^*_+)\\) the Jacobian is more complex and we will skip the analysis here.",

    "text": "5.4 Competition Models\nIn ecological systems, species often compete for limited resources, such as food or territory. This competition influences their growth rates and can determine their survival and dominance within an ecosystem. The Lotka-Volterra competition model provides a framework to study these dynamics, extending the principles of logistic growth to account for interspecies interactions.\n\n5.4.1 Lotka-Volterra Competition Dynamics\nThe model is formulated as follows for two competing species \\(N_1\\) and \\(N_2\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\frac{dN_1}{dt} &= r_1N_1 \\left(1 - \\frac{N_1 + b_{12}N_2}{K_1}\\right),\\\\\n\\frac{dN_2}{dt} &= r_2N_2 \\left(1 - \\frac{N_2 + b_{21}N_1}{K_2}\\right),\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nwhere \\(r_i\\) is the intrinsic growth rate and \\(K_i\\) is the carrying capacity of species \\(i\\). The coefficients \\(b_{ij}\\) represent the competitive effect of species \\(j\\) on species \\(i\\), effectively reducing the carrying capacity for species \\(i\\) due to the presence of species \\(j\\).\n\n\n5.4.2 Nondimensionalization of the Model\nTo simplify the analysis, we nondimensionalize the system using:\n\\[\nu_i = \\frac{N_i}{K_i}, \\quad a_{ij} = \\frac{b_{ij}K_j}{K_i}, \\quad \\tau = r_1 t, \\quad \\rho = \\frac{r_2}{r_1},\n\\]\nleading to:\n\\[\n\\frac{du_1}{d\\tau} = u_1(1 - u_1 - a_{12}u_2), ~~~~~ \\frac{du_2}{d\\tau} = \\rho u_2(1 - u_2 - a_{21}u_1).\n\\]\n\n\n5.4.3 Analysis of Steady States\nThe system has four potential steady states: \\((0, 0)\\), \\((0, 1)\\), \\((1, 0)\\), and a coexistence steady state \\(\\left(\\frac{1-a_{12}}{1-a_{12}a_{21}}, \\frac{1-a_{21}}{1-a_{12}a_{21}}\\right)\\).\nTo determine the stability of these points, we evaluate the Jacobian matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}(u_1, u_2)\\) at each steady state and analyze its eigenvalues:\n\nAt \\((0, 0)\\): The eigenvalues are \\(1\\) and \\(\\rho\\), indicating an unstable node as both are positive.\nAt \\((1, 0)\\): The eigenvalues are \\(-1\\) and \\(\\rho(1 - a_{21})\\). This point is a saddle if \\(a_{21} &lt; 1\\) and a stable node if \\(a_{21} &gt; 1\\).\nAt \\((0, 1)\\): By symmetry, this point behaves like \\((1, 0)\\) with roles reversed between species.\nCoexistence point \\(\\left(\\frac{1-a_{12}}{1-a_{12}a_{21}}, \\frac{1-a_{21}}{1-a_{12}a_{21}}\\right)\\): The stability is determined by the sign of the trace and the determinant of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\). The system’s behavior at this point depends on the specific values of \\(a_{12}\\) and \\(a_{21}\\), indicating potential scenarios where both species can coexist or one outcompetes the other.\n\n\n\n5.4.4 Nullclines and Phase Portraits\nNullclines, where the growth rate of one of the species are zero, are a very useful aid when drawing phase plane diagrams, also known as phase portraits. The nullclines for the Lotka-Volterra competition model are:\n\n\\(u_1\\) nullclines: \\(du_1/d\\tau = 0\\) when \\(u_1 = 0\\) or \\(u_2 = \\frac{1-u_1}{a_{12}}\\).\n\\(u_2\\) nullclines: \\(du_2/d\\tau = 0\\) when \\(u_2 = 0\\) or \\(u_2 = 1 - a_{21}u_1\\).\n\nAlong the \\(u_1\\) nullclines the flow is purely vertical and along the \\(u_2\\) nullclines the flow is purely horizontal. The intersection of the nullclines gives the steady states of the system. We can now draw the phase portrait to visualize the dynamics of the system. Very rough sketches are enough to understand the dynamics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Phase portrait of competition model when \\(a_{12}&lt;1\\) and \\(a_{21}&lt;1\\).\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2 shows the phase portrait of the competition model when \\(a_{12}&lt;1\\) and \\(a_{21}&lt;1\\). The nullclines are shown in grey and red, the flow lines in blue, with the arrows indicating the direction of the flow. The system exhibits a stable coexistence steady state, where both species persist in the ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Phase portrait of competition model when \\(a_{12}&gt;1\\) and \\(a_{21}&gt;1\\).\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3 illustrates the phase portrait of the competition model when \\(a_{12}&gt;1\\) and \\(a_{21}&gt;1\\). In this scenario, the coexistence steady state is a saddle, leading to the exclusion of one species. Which species dominates depends on the initial conditions. If the initial condition is below the separatrix, species 1 will dominate, and if it is above, species 2 will dominate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: Phase portrait of competition model when \\(a_{12}&lt;1\\) and \\(a_{21}&gt;1\\).\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4 depicts the phase portrait of the competition model when \\(a_{12}&lt;1\\) and \\(a_{21}&gt;1\\). In this case, the coexistence steady state has disappeared (it has moved into a region with negative population numbers that is not ecologically relevant). Irrespective of initial conditions, the system will evolve towards the state where only species 1 exists. Species 2 is driven to extinction.\nWe are not drawing the case \\(a_{12}&gt;1\\) and \\(a_{21}&lt;1\\) as it is similar to the case \\(a_{12}&lt;1\\) and \\(a_{21}&gt;1\\) just with the role of species 1 and 2 reversed. In this case species 2 will dominate and species 1 will go extinct.\n\n\n5.4.5 Competitive Exclusion Principle\nThe competitive exclusion principle, proposed by Gause in the 1930s, states that two species competing for the same resources cannot coexist indefinitely, with one species eventually outcompeting the other.\nIn the model we studied the two species shared resources but each also had its own resources, hence we observed a weaker form of the competitive exclusion principle. The coexistence steady state was stable when the competition was weak enough, allowing both species to persist in the ecosystem. This highlights the delicate balance between competition and coexistence in ecological systems, where the strength of interspecies interactions plays a crucial role in determining the long-term dynamics of species populations.",

This phenomenon, known as May’s “orgy of mutual benefaction,” highlights the need for constraints in mutualism models to avoid predicting ecological impossibilities.\nThrough this mutualism model, we gain insights into how species interactions can foster increased growth and stability, contrasting with competitive dynamics. It underscores the diversity of ecological interactions and their varying implications for species survival and community structure.",

    "text": "6.1 SIR model\nThe SIR model is a very idealised mathematical model that is commonly used to describe the spread of infectious diseases in a population. The acronym SIR stands for Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered, which are the three main compartments of the model.\nThe SIR model was first introduced in 1927 by Kermack and McKendrick in their landmark paper “A Contribution to the Mathematical Theory of Epidemics”. The model was developed in response to the major epidemics of the early 20th century, such as the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-1919, which highlighted the need for a quantitative understanding of the spread of infectious diseases.\nThe SIR model was one of the first mathematical models to be developed for the study of infectious disease dynamics, and it remains one of the most widely used and influential models in the field of mathematical epidemiology. The model has been used to study a wide range of infectious diseases, including measles, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and COVID-19, and has been extended and adapted to address new challenges and incorporate new data sources.\nThe SIR model and its variants have played a key role in informing public health policy and practice, by providing insights into the impact of different intervention strategies, such as vaccination, quarantine, and social distancing. The model has also helped to guide the design of clinical trials and the development of new drugs and vaccines, and has contributed to our understanding of the fundamental principles of infectious disease transmission.",

    "text": "6.1.1 Three-compartment model\nIn the SIR model, individuals in a population are divided into three groups: those who are susceptible to the disease (\\(S\\)), those who are infected with the disease (\\(I\\)), and those who have recovered from the disease and are now immune (\\(R\\)). The model assumes that individuals can move between these compartments over time as the disease spreads through the population.\nThe \\(R\\) component is also sometimes referred to as the “Removed” component in case where it also contains individuals that have been removed from being affected by the illness by other causes. For example in the case of a fatal disease they might have died.\nThe SIR model is based on a set of ordinary differential equations, which describe the rate of change of each compartment over time. The equations are\n\\[\\begin{split}\n\\frac{dS}{dt} &= -\\beta IS/N,\\\\\n\\frac{dI}{dt} &= \\beta IS/N -\\gamma I,\\\\\n\\frac{dR}{dt} &= \\gamma I,\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{6.1}\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(S\\) is the number of susceptible individuals in the population\n\\(I\\) is the number of infected individuals in the population\n\\(R\\) is the number of recovered (and immune) individuals in the population\n\\(N=S+I+R\\) is the total population size\n\\(\\beta\\) is the transmission rate of the disease, which describes how easily the disease is transmitted from an infected individual to a susceptible individual\n\\(\\gamma\\) is the recovery rate of the disease, which describes how quickly infected individuals recover and become immune to the disease\n\nThe first equation describes the rate of change of the susceptible compartment over time. It states that the number of susceptible individuals decreases over time as they become infected with the disease at a rate proportional to the proportion \\(I/N\\) of infected individuals and the transmission rate \\(\\beta\\). The minus sign indicates that the number of susceptible individuals is decreasing over time.\nThe second equation describes the rate of change of the infected compartment over time. It states that the number of infected individuals increases over time at the same rate at which the susceptibles become infected, and decreases over time as infected individuals recover at a rate \\(\\gamma\\).\nThe third equation describes the rate of change of the recovered compartment over time. It states that the number of recovered individuals increases over time as infected individuals recover and become immune at the recovery rate \\(\\gamma\\).\n\n\n6.1.2 Assumptions made by SIR model\nLike all models, the SIR model makes a number of simplifying assumptions to make the calculations tractable and the results interpretable. it is important to note that therefore an SIR model will not capture all of the nuances of disease transmission in a real population. The assumptions made by the SIR model include:\n\nFixed population: The SIR model assumes that the total population size \\(N=S+I+R\\) is fixed and does not change over time. We can see that by observing that \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt}=\\frac{dS}{dt}+\\frac{dI}{dt}+\\frac{dR}{dt}=0.\n\\] So there is no population dynamics such as birth or natural death (death from the illness itself can be included by viewing the \\(R\\) component as the “removed” component) or immigration or emigration. Neglecting population dynamics is fine if the spread of the disease happens much faster than the population dynamics.\nWell-mixed population: The SIR model assumes that the population is well-mixed, meaning that all individuals have the same probability of coming into contact with one another, regardless of their location or social network. That is why the total rate of infection is simply proportional to both \\(S\\) and \\(I\\), which is also known as the mass-action dynamics, a concept taken over from the modelling of chemical reactions.\nNo vaccinations: The SIR model assumes that there are no vaccinations available for the disease, and that individuals can only become immune to the disease by recovering from the infection.\nNo incubation period: The SIR model assumes that there is no incubation period, which means that individuals move directly from the susceptible compartment to the infectious compartment once they become infected. This assumption is often referred to as the “instantaneous transmission” assumption.\nHowever, in reality, many infectious diseases have an incubation period, during which the person is infected but not yet infectious to others. We will later discuss an extension of the SIR model called the SEIR model in which a new compartment is added, called the exposed (E) compartment. The exposed compartment represents individuals who have been infected but are not yet infectious.\nConstant transmission and recovery rates: The SIR model assumes that the transmission rate \\(\\beta\\) and the recovery rate \\(\\gamma\\) remain constant over time. Constant \\(\\beta\\) means that the probability of an infected individual transmitting the disease to a susceptible individual is the same at any point during the epidemic as well as at any point during an individual’s illness. Similarly, constant \\(\\gamma\\) means that the probability of and infected individual recovering from the illness is the same at any time.\nIn reality, the transmission rate and recovery rate of an infectious disease can vary over time due to factors such as changes in behavior and public health interventions, or evolution of the virus.\nNo loss of immunity: The SIR model assumes that individuals who recover from the disease become permanently immune to the disease and do not lose their immunity over time. This means that individuals who have recovered from the disease cannot become re-infected. We will however later make modifications of the model that allow for loss of immunity.\nNo age structure: The SIR model assumes that the population is homogeneous, meaning that all individuals have the same susceptibility, infectiousness, and recovery rates. This means that the model does not take into account the age structure of the population, which can affect disease transmission.\nNo spatial structure: The SIR model does not model how the disease spreads spatially. We will however later introduce spatial structure and model the movement of infected individuals so that we can study how the disease spreads through space.\n\nEven though the assumptions made by the SIR model may not be true in the real world, the model still provides a useful framework for understanding the spread of infectious diseases and how different interventions can affect the course of an outbreak.\n\n\n6.1.3 Condition for an epidemic\nLet us investigate the possibility of an epidemic. So we start with initial conditions where the number of infecteds is small and the number of susceptibles is high. There are no recovereds yet. We’ll write the initial conditions as\n\\[\nS(0)=S_0, ~~~ I(0)=I_0, ~~~R(0)=0,\n\\] with \\(S_0\\approx N\\) and \\(I_0 &lt;&lt; N\\).\nIn order for an epidemic to start we need a positive rate of increase in the number of infecteds. Thus we need \\[\n\\left.\\frac{dI}{dt}\\right|_{t=0} = \\beta I_0S_0/N -\\gamma I_0&gt;0.\n\\] This happens when \\[\nR_0 :=\\frac{\\beta S_0}{\\gamma N} &gt; 1.\n\\]\nWe have introduced the basic reproduction ratio \\(R_0\\). It is a key parameter in infectious disease epidemiology that measures the average number of secondary infections that a single infectious individual will produce. It is a useful metric for understanding the potential for an infectious disease to spread through a population, because if \\(R_0\\) is greater than \\(1\\), then an epidemic can occur, as each infectious individual will produce more than one secondary infection on average, leading to a sustained increase in the number of infected individuals. If\\(R_0\\) is less than \\(1\\), then an epidemic can not occur, as each infectious individual will produce less than one secondary infection on average, leading to a decline in the number of infected individuals over time.\nThe basic reproduction ratio is also sometimes referred to as the basic reproductive number. Do not call it the basic reproductive rate because it is not a rate. There is also potential confusion due to the notation between \\(R_0\\) and \\(R(0)\\).\nIt is interesting to observe there are three ways an epidemic can start:\n\nThe infectiousness of the illness can increases until \\(\\beta &gt; \\gamma \\frac{N}{S_0}\\).\nThe recovery rate drops until \\(\\gamma &lt; \\beta \\frac{S_0}{N}\\)\nThe number of infecteds rises until \\(S_0&gt;\\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta}N\\).",

    "text": "6.2 How an epidemic unfolds\nLet us think about how an epidemic unfolds, once started. The epidemic begins with an initial number of infectious individuals, and as these individuals come into contact with susceptible individuals, the number of infectious individuals increases, and the number of susceptible individuals decreases. The number of individuals in the recovered compartment also increases as more individuals recover from the infection and become immune to the disease.\nThe epidemic reaches its peak when the number of infectious individuals in the population is at its maximum. After this point, the number of infectious individuals begins to decrease, and the number of recovered individuals continues to increase. The epidemic ends when the number of infectious individuals reaches zero and the disease is no longer spreading in the population.\nAs is usual with non-linear models, a direct solution of the set of differential equations in Eq. 6.1 is only possible numerically. Such a numerical solution is displayed in Figure 6.1.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import odeint\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Total population, N.\nN = 1000\n# Initial number of infected and recovered individuals, I0 and R0.\nI0, R0 = 1, 0\n# Everyone else, S0, is susceptible to infection initially.\nS0 = N - I0 - R0\n# Contact rate, beta, and mean recovery rate, gamma, (in 1/days).\nbeta, gamma = 0.3, 0.1\n\n# A grid of time points (in days)\nt = np.linspace(0, 160, 160)\n\n# The SIR model differential equations.\ndef deriv(y, t, N, beta, gamma):\n    S, I, R = y\n    dSdt = -beta * S * I / N\n    dIdt = beta * S * I / N - gamma * I\n    dRdt = gamma * I\n    return dSdt, dIdt, dRdt\n\n# Initial conditions vector\ny0 = S0, I0, R0\n# Integrate the SIR equations over the time grid, t.\nret = odeint(deriv, y0, t, args=(N, beta, gamma))\nS, I, R = ret.T\n\n# Plot the data on three separate curves for S(t), I(t), and R(t)\nfig = plt.figure(facecolor='w')\nax = fig.add_subplot(111, facecolor='#dddddd', axisbelow=True)\nax.plot(t, S/N, 'b', alpha=0.5, lw=2, label='Susceptible')\nax.plot(t, I/N, 'r', alpha=0.5, lw=2, label='Infected')\nax.plot(t, R/N, 'g', alpha=0.5, lw=2, label='Recovered')\nax.set_xlabel('Time [days]')\nax.set_ylabel('Proportion of Population')\nax.set_ylim(0,1.1)\nax.yaxis.set_tick_params(length=0)\nax.xaxis.set_tick_params(length=0)\nax.grid(True, which='major', c='w', lw=2, ls='-')\nlegend = ax.legend()\nlegend.get_frame().set_alpha(0.5)\nfor spine in ('top', 'right', 'bottom', 'left'):\n    ax.spines[spine].set_visible(False)\nplt.title(\"SIR Model Evolution\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Evolution of an epidemic as described by the SIR model. The graph shows the dynamics of the susceptible \\(S\\), infected \\(I\\), and recovered \\(R\\) population fractions over time. In this scenario, we start with a single infected individual in a population of 1000, with a contact rate of \\(\\beta=0.3\\) and a recovery rate of \\(\\gamma=0.1\\). The plot demonstrates how the infection spreads through the population, peaks, and eventually declines as individuals recover and gain immunity.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe however are interested in analytic insights. It turns out that it is easy to determine the shape of the trajectories in the SIR phase space.\n\n6.2.1 Trajectory in S-I plane\nFirst we will determine how the number of infecteds changes with the number of susceptibles. This is described by the differential equation\n\\[\n\\frac{dI}{dS}=\\frac{dI/dt}{dS/dt}=\\frac{\\beta IS-\\gamma IN}{-\\beta IS}=-1+\\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta}\\frac{N}{S}\n\\tag{6.2}\\] We can easily integrate this equation: \\[\n\\int_{I_0}^{I(S)} d\\tilde{I}=\\int_{S_0}^S\\left(-1+\\frac{\\gamma N}{\\beta \\tilde{S}}\\right)d\\tilde{S}\n\\] gives \\[\nI(S)-I_0 = -S+S_0+\\frac{\\gamma N}{\\beta}\\log\\left( \\frac{S}{S_0}\\right),\n\\] which we can rewrite as \\[\nI(S) = N-S + \\frac{\\gamma N}{\\beta}\\log \\frac{S}{S_0},\n\\tag{6.3}\\] where we used that \\(N=S_0+I_0\\).\n\n\nCode\ndef I(S, S0, N, beta, gamma):\n    return N - S + gamma * N / beta * np.log(S / S0)\n\n# S values\nSv = np.linspace(1, N, 100)\n\n# Compute I(S)\nIv = I(Sv, S0, N, beta, gamma)\nIv[Iv &lt; 0] = 0  # Ensure I(S) is non-negative\nS_threshold = gamma / beta * N\nImax = I(S_threshold, S0, N, beta, gamma)\n\n# Plot setup with style similar to the SIR model plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(5.5, 4), facecolor='w')\nax = plt.subplot(111, facecolor='#dddddd')\n\n# Plotting I(S) and initial conditions\nax.plot(Sv, Iv, 'b-', lw=2, label='$I(S)$')\nax.plot(S0, I0, 'ro', label='Initial condition $(S_0, I_0)$')\n\n# Adding horizontal and vertical lines for Imax and S=gamma N/beta\nax.axhline(y=Imax, color='k', linestyle='--', lw=1.5, label=r'$I_{max}$')\nax.axvline(x=S_threshold, color='k', linestyle='--', lw=1.5, label=r'$S=\\gamma N/\\beta$')\n\n# Adding grid, labels, title, and legend\nax.set_xlabel('Number of Susceptible Individuals (S)')\nax.set_ylabel('Number of Infected Individuals (I)')\nax.set_title('Trajectory of the Epidemic in the S-I Plane')\nax.grid(True, which='major', c='w', lw=2, ls='--')\nlegend = ax.legend(loc='lower center')\nlegend.get_frame().set_alpha(0.5)\n\n# Adjusting spines to match the SIR model plot style\nfor spine in ('top', 'right', 'bottom', 'left'):\n    ax.spines[spine].set_visible(False)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Shape of epidemic in S-I plane\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is depicted in Figure 6.2. It agrees with our earlier intuitive description of how an epidemic unfolds. The number of infecteds increases with the number of susceptibles until the number of susceptibles is low enough that the number of infecteds reaches its maximum. After this point, the number of infecteds begins to decrease as the number of susceptibles decreases further.\nWe can use this result to determine the number \\(I_{max}\\) of infected individuals at the peak of the epidemic.\n\n\n6.2.2 Peak of an epidemic\nKnowing the maximum number of infected individuals can help public health officials plan for the allocation of resources such as hospital beds, medical staff, and equipment. This information can be used to anticipate the surge in demand for healthcare services and to prepare for the management of large numbers of patients. It can also be used to guide the planning of interventions such as vaccinations in order to avoid overstretching the health system at the peak of the epidemic. We will discuss that in ?sec-vaccinations.\nThe peak is where \\(dI/dS=0\\), which according to Eq. 6.2 happens at \\(S=\\gamma N/\\beta\\). Thus according to Eq. 6.3 \\[\nI_{max}=I\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta}N\\right)\n=N-\\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta}N\\left(1-\\log\\frac{\\gamma N}{\\beta S_0}\\right)\n\\] We can express this in terms of the basic reproduction ratio \\(R_0\\) as \\[\nI_{max}= N-\\frac{S_0}{R_0}(1+\\log R_0)\n\\]\n\n\n6.2.3 Trajectory in R-S plane\nNext we will determine the relationship between the number of susceptibles and the number of recovereds, by using \\[\n\\frac{dS}{dR}=\\frac{dS/dt}{dR/dt}= -\\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma}\\frac{S}{N}.\n\\] This is solved by \\[\nS(R) = S_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma}\\frac{R}{N}\\right)\n\\] This is depicted in Figure 6.3. We see in particular that the number of susceptibles decreases exponentially with the number of recovereds but never reaches zero. This means that at the time where the last infected individual recovers and the epidemic ends, there are still individuals that never caught the disease.\n\n\nCode\ndef S(R, S0, N, beta, gamma):\n    return S0 * np.exp(-beta / gamma * R / N)\n\n# R values\nRv = np.linspace(1, N, 100)\n\n# Compute S(R)\nSv = S(Rv, S0, N, beta, gamma)\n\n# Plot setup with style similar to the SIR model plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(5.5, 4), facecolor='w')\nax = plt.subplot(111, facecolor='#dddddd')\n\n# Plotting S(R) and initial conditions\nax.plot(Rv, Sv, 'b-', lw=2, label='$S(R)$')\nax.plot(R0, S0, 'ro', label='Initial condition $(R_0, S_0)$')\n\n# Adding grid, labels, title, and legend\nax.set_xlabel('Number of Recovered Individuals (R)')\nax.set_ylabel('Number of Susceptible Individuals (S)')\nax.set_title('Trajectory of the Epidemic in the R-S Plane')\nax.grid(True, which='major', c='w', lw=2, ls='--')\nlegend = ax.legend(loc='upper right')\nlegend.get_frame().set_alpha(0.5)\n\n# Adjusting spines to match the SIR model plot style\nfor spine in ('top', 'right', 'bottom', 'left'):\n    ax.spines[spine].set_visible(False)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: Shape of epidemic in R-S plane\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.2.4 Size of an epidemic\nBy the size of an epidemic we mean the total number of individuals that catches the disease in the course of the epidemic. As we saw above, this will be less than the total population number. Let us denote the numbers at the end of the epidemic by a subscript \\(\\infty\\). We have that \\(I(\\infty)=0\\) and \\(S(\\infty)\\) is the solution to the equation \\[\n\\begin{split}\nS_\\infty&=S(R_\\infty)=S_0\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma N}R_\\infty\\right)\\\\\n&=S_0\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma N}(N-S_\\infty)\\right)\\\\\n&=S_0\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma}\\right)\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma N}S_\\infty\\right).\n\\end{split}\n\\] This equation can be solved numerically. We can also get an approximate analytic solution in the case where the epidemic is large so that the fraction of the population that never gets infected is small compared to \\(\\gamma/\\beta\\), \\(S_\\infty/N&lt;&lt;\\gamma/\\beta\\). In this case we can expand the last exponential in the equation above to first order in \\(S_\\infty/N\\) to get the approximate equation \\[\nS_\\infty\\approx S_0\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma N}S_\\infty\\right)\n\\] This we can now easily solve for \\(S_\\infty\\) to get \\[\nS_\\infty\\approx \\frac{S_0e^{-\\beta/\\gamma}}{1-\\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma}\\frac{S_0}{N}e^{-\\beta/\\gamma}}.\n\\] We can express this in terms of the basic reproduction ratio \\(R_0\\) as \\[\n\\frac{S_\\infty}{S_0}\\approx \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta/\\gamma}-R_0}.\n\\]\n\n\n6.2.5 Initial exponential growth\nAt the start of the epidemic when the number of infecteds is small and hence the number of susceptibles is close to \\(N\\), we can approximate \\[\n\\frac{dI}{dt}=\\beta I\\frac{S}{N}-\\gamma I\\approx (\\beta -\\gamma)I\n\\] and hence \\[\nI(t)\\approx I_0e^{(\\beta -\\gamma)t}.\n\\tag{6.4}\\]\nWe can also get an equation for \\(R(t)\\) by using the equation for \\(S(R)\\) as follows: \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\frac{dR}{dt}&=\\gamma I=\\gamma \\left(N-R-S\\right)\\\\\n&=\\gamma \\left(N-R-S_0\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma}\\frac{R}{N}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{split}\n\\]\nAt the initial stages of the epidemic while the number of recovereds is small we can expand the exponential and keep only the first-order term to get \\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\frac{dR}{dt}&\n\\approx \\gamma \\left(N-R-S_0\\left(1-\\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma}\\frac{R}{N}\\right)\\right)\\\\\n&=\\gamma I_0 - \\gamma (1 + R_0)R\n\\end{split}\n\\] where we used that \\(N-S_0=I_0\\). Again we must not be confused by the notation: \\(R_0\\) is the basic reproduction number, not the number of recovered at time \\(0\\). We have a linear differential equation for \\(R(t)\\) that can be solved to give \\[\nR(t) = \\frac{I_0}{1+R_0} \\left(1-e^{-(1+R_0)\\gamma t}\\right).\n\\tag{6.5}\\]\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import odeint\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Total population, N.\nN = 1000\n# Initial number of infected and recovered individuals, I0 and R0.\nI0, R0 = 1, 0\n# Everyone else, S0, is susceptible to infection initially.\nS0 = N - I0 - R0\n# Contact rate, beta, and mean recovery rate, gamma, (in 1/days).\nbeta, gamma = 0.3, 0.1\n# Basic reproduction number\nbrn = beta*S0/gamma/N\n\n# A grid of time points (in days)\nt = np.linspace(0, 40, 160)\n\n# The SIR model differential equations.\ndef deriv(y, t, N, beta, gamma):\n    S, I, R = y\n    dSdt = -beta * S * I / N\n    dIdt = beta * S * I / N - gamma * I\n    dRdt = gamma * I\n    return dSdt, dIdt, dRdt\n\n# Initial conditions vector\ny0 = S0, I0, R0\n# Integrate the SIR equations over the time grid, t.\nret = odeint(deriv, y0, t, args=(N, beta, gamma))\nS, I, R = ret.T\n\n# Plot the data on three separate curves for S(t), I(t), and R(t)\nfig = plt.figure(facecolor='w')\nax = fig.add_subplot(111, facecolor='#dddddd', axisbelow=True)\nax.plot(t, I/N, 'r', alpha=0.5, lw=2, label='Infected')\nax.plot(t, R/N, 'g', alpha=0.5, lw=2, label='Recovered')\nax.set_xlabel('Time [days]')\nax.set_ylabel('Proportion of Population')\nax.set_ylim(0,0.4)\nax.yaxis.set_tick_params(length=0)\nax.xaxis.set_tick_params(length=0)\nax.grid(True, which='major', c='w', lw=2, ls='-')\nlegend = ax.legend()\nlegend.get_frame().set_alpha(0.5)\nfor spine in ('top', 'right', 'bottom', 'left'):\n    ax.spines[spine].set_visible(False)\nplt.title(\"SIR Model Evolution\")\n\n# Now add approximate results for beginning of epidemic\nIi = I0*np.exp((beta - gamma)*t)\nax.plot(t, Ii/N, 'r:', alpha=0.5, lw=4)\nRi = I0/(brn-1)*(np.exp((brn-1)*gamma*t)-1)\nax.plot(t, Ri/N, 'g:', alpha=0.5, lw=4)\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: Exponential approximation of initial growth of an epidemic.

It is an important metric for understanding the rate of spread of an infectious disease and can help public health officials anticipate the growth of an epidemic and plan for the allocation of resources such as hospital beds, medical staff, and equipment.\nFrom our initial exponential approximation for \\(I(t)\\) in Eq. 6.4, we see that the number of infecteds doubles in a time \\(t_d\\) when \\[\n2I_0 = I_0 e^{(\\beta -\\gamma)t_d},\n\\] which gives the doubling time \\[\nt_d = \\frac{\\log 2}{\\beta-\\gamma}.\n\\]",
