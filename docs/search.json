    "text": "1.1 Exponential model\nThis is the simplest and oldest model, introduced by Thomas Robert Malthus in 1798. If we assume that the per-capita birth rate \\(b\\) and the per-capita death rate \\(d\\) are fixed constants, then the general differential equation Eq. 1.1 becomes the linear equation \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt}=bN-dN=rN,\n\\tag{1.2}\\] where we introduced the new parameter \\(r=b-d\\). This equation is easy to solve: \\[\nN(t)=N_0\\,e^{rt}.\n\\tag{1.3}\\] If the birth rate exceeds the death rate and hence \\(r&gt;0\\), the model predicts exponential growth. In the opposite case of lower birth rate than death rate the model predicts exponential decay of the population number towards extinction. Only when birth and death rates are perfectly equal can the population stay steady over time. We illustrate that in Figure 1.1.\nFigure 1.1: Solutions to the exponential model.",

When the population gets closer to this limit its growth rate will decrease, for example due to competition for limited food sources or space, or due to disease. This decrease in the growth rate is captured by the logistic equation \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K}\\right),\n\\tag{1.4}\\] where \\(K\\) is the carrying capacity of the environment.

    "text": "1.3 Allee effect\nWarder Clyde Allee (1885-1955) was an American ecologist who studied the effects of population density on the growth rate of a population. He found that in some cases the per-capita growth rate can increase with \\(N\\). This is called the Allee effect. It can occur when the population is too small to find a mate, to find food, or to avoid predators.\nFigure Figure 1.4 shows the per-capita growth rate as a function of the population number for exponential growth in black, for logistic growth in blue and two different growth rates exhibiting the Allee effect in green and red.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: The per-capita growth rate as a function of the population number.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe green curve in Figure 1.4 shows a weak Allee effect, where the per-capita rate is small but possitive for small population sizes, then initially increases with the population size before then decreasing again as the population approaches its carrying capacity. The red curve shows a strong Allee effect, which is similar but so strong that the growth rate starts out not just small but actually negative for small \\(N\\).\nThe simplest model for the Allee effect is the logistic equation with a modified growth rate that includes another factor that decreases the growth rate for small \\(N\\): \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K}\\right)\\left(\\frac{N}{K_0}-1\\right).\n\\tag{1.6}\\] If \\(0&lt;K_0&lt;K\\), this exhibits the strong Allee effect because the growth rate is negative when \\(N&lt;K_0\\). This means that the population will be driven towards extinction when it is below the threshold size \\(K_0\\) and it will grow towards its carrying capacity when it is above \\(K_0\\). This is illustrated in Figure 1.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: The Allee growth rate as a function of the population number.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis phenomenon is important for conservation biology because it means that small populations are particularly vulnerable to extinction. It is also important for fisheries management because it means that the population can collapse if it falls below a certain threshold size. The phenomenon is called “critical depensation”. We will meet it again when we discuss harvesting later in this section.",

    "text": "1.4 General autonomous ODE model\nThe logistic model is a special case of a general autonomous ordinary differential equation (ODE) model \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt}=f(N),\n\\tag{1.7}\\] where \\(f(N)\\) is a function of \\(N\\) only, not \\(t\\). The logistic equation Eq. 1.4 is an example of such a model with\n\\[\nf(N)=rN\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K}\\right).\n\\]\nIf \\(f\\) is Lipschitz continuous, then, given \\(N(0)=N_0\\), there exists a unique solution \\(N(t)\\) to the initial value problem Eq. 1.7. This is a consequence of the Picard-Lindelöf theorem.\nWe are interested in the steady states of the model, i.e. the values \\(N^*\\) for which \\(f(N^*)=0\\). These are the values of \\(N\\) for which the population number does not change. To determine the stability of the steady states, we can look near \\(N^*\\) by writing \\(N(t)=N^*+n(t)\\) with \\(n(t)\\) small. Then \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt}=\\frac{dN^*}{dt}+\\frac{dn}{dt} = f(N^*+n(t))\\approx f(N^*)+f'(N^*)\\,n(t).\n\\] We now use that \\(dN^*/dt=0\\) and \\(f(N^*)=0\\) to find \\[\n\\frac{dn}{dt}\\approx f'(N^*)\\,n(t).\n\\] This is a linear equation for \\(n(t)\\) with solution \\[\nn(t)=n(0)e^{f'(N^*)t}\n\\] and we can use the sign of \\(f'(N^*)\\) to determine the stability of the steady state:\n\nIf \\(f'(N^*)&lt;0\\), then \\(n(t)\\) will decrease towards zero, and the steady state is stable.\nIf \\(f'(N^*)&gt;0\\), then \\(n(t)\\) will increase away from zero, and the steady state is unstable.\n\nIf \\(f'(N^*)=0\\), then we need to look at higher order terms to determine the stability.\nWe illustrate this in the example of the logistic model. The fixed points are \\(N^*=0\\) and \\(N^*=K\\). The derivative of \\(f(N)\\) is \\[\nf'(N)=r\\left(1-\\frac{2N}{K}\\right).\n\\] So we find that \\(f'(0)=r&gt;0\\) and \\(f'(K)=-r&lt;0\\). This means that the steady state \\(N^*=0\\) is unstable and the steady state \\(N^*=K\\) is stable. This agrees with what we had already seen graphically in Figure 1.2 and Figure 1.3.",

    "section": "1.5 Harvesting a renewable resource",
    "text": "1.5 Harvesting a renewable resource\nEcologists model populations not only out of academic interest but also for practical purposes. Humans are interested in exploiting the natural resources. They want o harvest fish from the sea, to hunt deer in the forest, and to cut down trees in the jungle. They want to do this in a way that is sustainable, i.e. that does not lead to the extinction of the resource, while at the same time giving the highest yield.\nMy personal interest is in understanding how fish populations react to different kinds of fishing. I use coupled partial integro-differential equations for that purpose, but most fisheries management is based on simpler models and we get a good first idea by using the logistic model, which we will now modify to include harvesting.\n\n1.5.1 Harvesting with fixed effort\nWe assume that in the absence of fishing the fish population number \\(N(t)\\) is governed by the logistic equation Eq. 1.4. We also assume that the fish are harvested at a rate \\(E N(t)\\), where \\(E\\) is the harvesting rate, which is determined by the effort that is put into fishing. This means that the rate of change in the fish population number is given by \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K}\\right)-EN = f(N).\n\\tag{1.8}\\] We can rewrite this equation in the form of a logistic equation with modified parameters: \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\\left(\\left(1-\\frac{E}{r}\\right)-\\frac{N}{K}\\right).\n\\tag{1.9}\\] This makes it easy to read off the fixed points \\(N^*=0\\) and \\(N^*=K\\left(1-\\frac{E}{r}\\right)\\). The nonzero fixed point gets smaller when fishing effort \\(E\\) increases. This is illustrated in Figure 1.6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Growth rate when harvesting with fixed effort.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are now interested in finding out at what level we should fish in order to achive the maximum sustainable yield (MSY). This is the level of fishing effort that gives the highest possible yield that can be sustained indefinitely. So we are interested in the yield at the non-zero fixed point \\(N^*=K\\left(1-\\frac{E}{r}\\right)\\). The yield is the amount of fish that can be harvested per unit time, and it is given at the fixed point by \\[\nY=EN^*=EK\\left(1-\\frac{E}{r}\\right).\n\\] We can find the maximum of \\(Y\\) by differentiating with respect to \\(E\\) and setting the derivative equal to zero: \\[\n\\frac{dY}{dE}=K\\left(1-\\frac{2E}{r}\\right)=0.\n\\] We can solve this equation for \\(E\\) to find the optimal fishing effort \\(E^*\\): \\[\nE^*=\\frac{r}{2}.\n\\] The resulting maximum sustainable yield is \\[\nMSY=\\frac{r}{2}K\\left(1-\\frac{r}{2r}\\right)=\\frac{rK}{4}.\n\\]\n\n\n1.5.2 Harvesting with fixed quote\nFisheries managers in the Mediterranean are aiming to control the fishing effort in order to achieve the maximum sustainable yield, and we have seen how to model that in the previous section. Fisheries in the North Sea or the North Atlantic however are instead managed by setting the total allowable catch (TAC) for the whole fleet. This is a fixed quota for the total amount of fish that can be harvested in a year. To model that policy we use the logistic equation with harvesting, but we replace the harvesting rate \\(EN\\) by a harvesting quota \\(Q\\): \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K}\\right)-Q.\n\\tag{1.10}\\] This is visualised in Figure 1.7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.7: Growth rate when harvesting with fixed quota.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that any non-zero quota leads to critical depensation, i.e., it introduces a critical threshold below which the population will collapse. This is a well-known problem in fisheries management, and it is the reason why the TAC is set to zero for some fish stocks. As the fishing quota is increased, the critical depensation threshold moves to higher population numbers and the stable steady state moves to lower population numbers. Eventually all non-zero fixed points disappear and the population collapses.",

Other exercises are optional but recommended.\n\n*Sketching solutions\n\nExercise 1.1 Consider the population model with carrying capacity and Allee effect given by the differential equation \\[\\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K}\\right)\\left(\\frac{N}{K_0}-1\\right).\\] Here \\(r&gt;0\\), \\(K&gt;K_0&gt;0\\) are constants. Simply by considering the shape of the right hand side, sketch a graph with several solutions for different initial conditions. Choose two initial conditions between \\(0\\) and \\(K_0\\), two initial conditions between \\(K_0\\) and \\(K\\) and one initial condition larger than \\(K\\). Note that the graph only needs to be qualitatively correct, similar to the rough sketch for the solutions of the logistic model sketched in the first lecture.\n\n\n\n+Von Bertalanffy growth\n\nExercise 1.2 Assume the weight \\(w(t)\\) of an individual fish at time \\(t\\) is governed by the differential equation \\[\\frac{dw}{dt}=\\alpha\\,w^{2/3}-\\beta w\\] with initial condition \\(w(0)=w_0\\) (the weight at birth), and where \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are positive parameters depending on the fish species.\n\nWithout solving the differential equation, just thinking about fixed points and their stability, determine \\(\\lim_{t\\rightarrow\\infty}w(t)\\).\nDerive the linear first order ODE for \\(u=w^{1/3}\\) and solve it.\nUse the solution for \\(u\\) to find the solution for \\(w\\).\n\n\n\n\nSolving logistic equation\n\nExercise 1.3 By using separation of variables and partial fractions, solve the logistic equation \\[\\frac{dN}{dt}=rN\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K}\\right)\\] with initial condition \\(N(0)=N_0\\).\n\n\n\n* Harvesting with fixed effort\n\nExercise 1.4 Consider a population \\(N(t)\\) that is described by the by the Gompertz model \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = \\alpha N \\log\\frac{K}{N},\n\\] where \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(K\\) are positive constants. You want to harvest this population, for example by hunting or fishing, with some effort \\(E\\). The rate at which you harvest individuals (which removes them from the population and hence results in an additional source of death) is proportional to the size of the population: \\(Y = E N\\). This is called the yield. Write down the differential equation for \\(N(t)\\) including this harvesting term. Determine the fixed points and their stability. Find the maximum sustainable yield, i.e., the maximum yield that can be sustained indefinitely.\n\n\n\nHarvesting with fixed quota\n\nExercise 1.5 As in Exercise 1.4, consider a population \\(N(t)\\) that is described by the Gompertz model. Imagine that this describes a fish population in a lake where fishing is going to be introduced, and that you are tasked with setting the quota that limits the rate at which the fishers are allowed to take fish out of the lake. The fishers demand that you set the quota to the maximum sustainable level. What is the maximum sustainable quota according to the model? Would it be wise to give in to the demand of the fishers and set the quota at this level?\n\n\n\nWasps\n\nExercise 1.6 In a colony of the European Hornet there is a single queen that produces all the offspring. It produces two kinds of offspring: workers and reproducers. We’ll denote the number of workers alive at time \\(t\\) by \\(n(t)\\) and the number of reproducers by \\(N(t)\\). The workers are responsible for collecting food. They can’t breed themselves and they die in the winter. However they are necessary to allow the queen to reproduce because without the food that they are collecting the queen would have nothing to eat. So we need workers. But because they die in winter, they don’t help the survival of the colony in the long run. That’s where the reproducers come in. They don’t do any work, but they can, if they survive the winter, breed in the next spring as new queens.\nSo the queen now has a strategy of how to proceed: It first of all needs to produce workers, and from time zero to time \\(t_c\\) it only produces workers. We assume that the birth rate is proportional to the number of workers, so that the total birth rate of workers is \\(r n(t)\\) for some constant \\(r&gt;0\\). The queen then switches to producing only reproducers from time \\(t_c\\) up to the start of winter at time \\(T\\) and we assume that the total birth rate of reproducers is \\(R n(t)\\) for some constant \\(R&gt;0\\). We also assume that until the start of winter there are no deaths.\nWhat is the optimal time \\(t_c\\) at which the queen should switch from producing workers to producing reproducers in order to achieve the largest number of producers \\(N(T)\\) at the start of the winter and therefore to the largest number of wasps in the following year.\n\n\n\nWasps with death\n\nExercise 1.7 In the wasp example from question 1, assume that the worker wasps die at a constant per-capita rate \\(d\\) but the reproducers do not die. Also assume that at time t=0 there is one worker, n(0)=1. Keep the birth rates as in Exercise 1.6. Determine the number of workers \\(n(t)\\) for any time between \\(t_c\\) and \\(T\\). Determine the number of reproducers at the onset of winter at time \\(T\\). Derive the optimal time for the switchover time \\(t_c\\).",

    "section": "2.2 Models with limited carrying capacity",
    "text": "2.2 Models with limited carrying capacity\nRecall how we introduced the logistic model by assuming that the per-capita birth rate declines linearly with the population number and vanishes when the population reaches its carrying capacity. This gave us the equation \\[\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = rN\\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right)\n\\tag{2.5}\\] where \\(r\\) is the per-capita growth rate and \\(K\\) is the carrying capacity.\nIt turns out that there are several models which all deserve to be called the discrete-time logistic model.\n\n2.2.1 Verhulst model\nThe most famous discrete-time logistic model is the Verhulst model.\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\nN_{t+1} &= (R_0+1)N_t\\left(1 - \\frac{N_t}{K(R_0+1)/R_0}\\right)\\\\\n&=N_t + R_0 N_t\\left(1 - \\frac{N_t}{K}\\right)=f(N_t).\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{2.6}\\] Again it is important to stress that \\(R_0\\) is not a growth rate but a dimensionless growth factor.\nWe have written the model in two alternative forms because the first form makes the analogy with the continuous-time logistic model more obvious, while the second form makes it easier to read off the fixed point.\nThe fixed point is a value for which \\(N_{t+1}=N_t\\), i.e. a value of \\(N\\) for which the population number does not change from year to year. Thus it is a value \\(N^*\\) for which \\(f(N^*)=N^*\\). Using the second form of the model, we can see easily that the fixed points are \\(N^*=0\\) and \\(N^*=K\\), so \\(K\\) is the carrying capacity.\nA problem with the Verhulst model is that it can give rise to negative population numbers. This is not realistic, so we are motivated to modify the model to prevent this.\n\n\n2.2.2 Ricker model\nThe Ricker model is a modification of the Verhulst model that prevents negative population numbers. It is given by \\[\nN_{t+1} = N_t\\, e^{R_0\\left(1 - \\frac{N_t}{K}\\right)}.\n\\tag{2.7}\\] By moving the logistic factor inside the exponential, the Ricker model prevents negative population numbers. The fixed points are still \\(N^*=0\\) and \\(N^*=K\\). Ricker introduced this model to describe salmon populations.\n\n\n2.2.3 Beverton-Holt model\nThe Beverton-Holt model is another modification of the Verhulst model which prevents negative population numbers. It is given by \\[\nN_{t+1} = \\frac{R N_t}{1 - \\frac{R-1}{K}N_t}.\n\\tag{2.8}\\] This has been a very influential model in fisheries science. On the face of it the model does not look very similar to the logistic model, but we will see the relationship when we solve the model. The Beverton-Holt model is one of the rare cases where a non-linear model can be solved exactly. The trick is to make a change of variables from \\(N_t\\) to \\(u_t = 1/N_t\\). Then we have \\[\nu_{t+1} = \\frac{1}{N_{t+1}} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{R-1}{K}N_t}{R N_t} = \\frac{u_t}{R} - \\frac{R-1}{R K}.\n\\tag{2.9}\\] This is a linear equation for \\(u_t\\), and linear equations are easy to solve. The easiest way to proceed is to look at the first few terms of the sequence \\(u_t\\) and guess the general form of the solution. We find \\[\\begin{split}\nu_1 &= \\frac{u_0}{R} - \\frac{R-1}{R K},\\\\\nu_2 &= \\frac{u_0}{R^2} - \\frac{R-1}{R K}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{R}\\right),\\\\\nu_3 &= \\frac{u_0}{R^3} - \\frac{R-1}{R K}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{R} + \\frac{1}{R^2}\\right),\\\\\n&\\vdots\\\\\nu_t &= \\frac{u_0}{R^t} - \\frac{R-1}{R K}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{R} + \\frac{1}{R^2} + \\ldots + \\frac{1}{R^{t-1}}\\right).\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{2.10}\\] The sum in the second term is a geometric series. We know the general formula for a geometric series: \\[\n1 + x + x^2 + \\ldots + x^{t-1} = \\frac{1 - x^t}{1 - x}.\n\\tag{2.11}\\]\nWe can use this with \\(x=1/R\\) to sum terms in the second term. We find \\[\nu_t = \\frac{u_0}{R^t} - \\frac{R-1}{R K}\\frac{1 - (1/R)^t}{1 - 1/R}.\n\\] We simplify this a bit and bring everything on the same denominator. \\[\nu_t = \\frac{u_0}{R^t} - \\frac{(1/R)^t-1}{K}\n=\\frac{Ku_0-1+R^t}{KR^t}.\n\\tag{2.12}\\]\nWe can now change back to \\(N_t=1/u_t\\) to find the solution to the Beverton-Holt model. We find \\[\\begin{split}\nN_t &= \\frac{1}{u_t}=\\frac{K R^t}{Ku_0-1+R^t}\\\\\n&=\\frac{K/u_0}{KR^{-t}-R^{-t}/u_0+1/u_0}\\\\\n&=\\frac{KN_0}{N_0+(K-N_0)R^{-t}}.\n\\end{split} \\tag{2.13}\\]\nThis is the solution to the Beverton-Holt model. Comparing this to the solution of the continuous-time logistic model \\[\nN(t) = \\frac{KN_0}{N_0+(K-N_0)\\exp(-rt)}\n\\tag{2.14}\\] we see that they agree at integer times \\(t\\) if we measure time in years and set \\(R=\\exp(r \\cdot 1\\text{ year}).\\)",

    "text": "2.3 Stability and Cobwebs\nWe now want to study the stability of the fixed points in discrete-time models. As discussed, fixed points \\(N^*\\) satisfy the equation \\(N^*=f(N^*)\\). We study the stability of the fixed points by looking at the sequence \\(N_t\\) for \\(t\\) close to the fixed point. That means we write \\(N(t)=N^*+n_t\\) for \\(n_t&lt;&lt;1\\). We then have \\[\n\\begin{split}\nN_{t+1} = N^*+n_{t+1}=f(N_t) = f(N^*+n_t) = f(N^*) + f'(N^*)n_t + \\ldots\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{2.15}\\] where we have used the Taylor expansion of \\(f\\) around \\(N^*\\). Because \\(N^*\\) is a fixed point, we have \\(f(N^*)=N^*\\). Thus we find that \\[\nn_{t+1} \\approx f'(N^*)n_t\n\\tag{2.16}\\] where we neglected the higher order terms in the Taylor expansion. This is a linear equation for \\(n_t\\) that we know how to solve: \\[\nn_t = n_0 (f'(N^*))^t.\n\\tag{2.17}\\] So we have found that:\n\nIf \\(|f'(N^*)|&lt;1\\), then \\(n_t\\) will decrease with time and the fixed point is stable.\nIf \\(|f'(N^*)|&gt;1\\), then \\(n_t\\) will increase with time and the fixed point is unstable.\n\nIf \\(|f'(N^*)|=1\\), then we cannot say anything about the stability of the fixed point from this analysis.\nIn the continuous-time case we also had a graphical way to see the stability of fixed points. We will now introduce a graphical method for studying the stability of fixed points in discrete-time models, called the cobweb method.\nWe plot the function \\(f(N_t)\\) and the line \\(N_{t+1}=N_t\\). The fixed points are the intersection points of the function and the line. We then draw the graph of the sequence \\(N_t\\) by starting at the initial population number \\(N_0\\) and iterating the function \\(f(N_t)\\) to find \\(N_1\\), then iterating the function again to find \\(N_2\\), and so on. The graph of the sequence \\(N_t\\) is called the cobweb. The stability of the fixed points can be read off from the cobweb. If the cobweb spirals into the fixed point, as shown in Figure 2.1, then the fixed point is stable. If the cobweb spirals out of the fixed point, as shown in Figure 2.2, then the fixed point is unstable. You have to press the play button below the figures to see the cobweb diagrams in action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n      \n          \n      \n        \n      \n          \n      \n          \n      \n          \n      \n          \n      \n          \n      \n          \n      \n          \n    \n    \n      \n      Once\n      \n      Loop\n      \n      Reflect\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Cobweb diagram for a stable fixed point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n      \n          \n      \n        \n      \n          \n      \n          \n      \n          \n      \n          \n      \n          \n      \n          \n      \n          \n    \n    \n      \n      Once\n      \n      Loop\n      \n      Reflect\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Cobweb diagram for an unstable fixed point.\n\n\n\n\nThe oscillatory nature of the sequence \\(N_t\\), hopping from one side of the fixed point to the other, that creates the cobweb pattern is due to the fact that the slope of \\(f\\) is negative at the fixed point. The graphical method for visualising the iterations will work also when the slope is positive at the fixed point, but it will not look like a cobweb. Figure 2.3 shows the cobweb for a stable fixed point with positive slope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n      \n          \n      \n        \n      \n          \n      \n          \n      \n          \n      \n          \n      \n          \n      \n          \n      \n          \n    \n    \n      \n      Once\n      \n      Loop\n      \n      Reflect\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Cobweb diagram for a fixed point with positive slope.",

Other exercises are optional but recommended.\n\n+ Verhulst model\n\nExercise 2.1 For some choices of the parameters, the Verhulst model \\[N_{t+1}=rN_t\\left(1-\\frac{N_t}{K}\\right) \\tag{2.18}\\] can lead to negative population numbers even when initially starting with a positive population below its carrying capacity. Derive the condition on the parameters for this to happen. One good way to approach this is to think about what the cobweb diagram would have to look like for such a scenario.\n\n\n\n* Ricker model\n\nExercise 2.2 Find the fixed points in the Ricker model \\[\nN_{t+1} = N_t\\, e^{R_0\\left(1 - \\frac{N_t}{K}\\right)}.\n\\tag{2.19}\\] and investigate their stability. Do this both analytically and by drawing cobweb diagrams.\n\n\n\nBeverton-Holt model\n\nExercise 2.3 Find the fixed points in the Beverton-Holt model \\[\nN_{t+1} = \\frac{R N_t}{1 - \\frac{R-1}{K}N_t}.\n\\tag{2.20}\\] and investigate their stability.
